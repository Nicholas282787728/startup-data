    "1. Access the CB API (with my login info), which is inside Dropbox. Download the list of companies founded in 2016 and with category ‘Artificial Intelligence’. That should be 500sh companies, we start with a small sample.\n",
    "2. For each of those companies, download all the NEWS that Crunchbase has. Try to put those news into an easy format: maybe a TXT file per news, and all TXT files of a company into one folder. And remove all non-relevant components (like Ads or other text). This will make it easier if somebody in the team will have to do some reading.\n",
    "3. Once this looks good, we’ll do some NLP on the text. But let’s get the \"raw data\" first.\n",

    "Hi Kevin\n",
    "Thanks again for coming in! And great job – this is an excellent first step.\n",
    "Here are the next steps:\n",
    "1. I went through the folders – most look good, but it’s possible there’s some missing material. Spend a little more time to perfect the downloading  code. See if you can fix whichever errors you find through the process. It might be best to make this code as smooth as possible now, before we scale to working with lots of companies.\n",
    "2. I am assuming the scraping process is OK, but it’s probably helpful to take one more look at that too (i.e. for example, those few lines missing in the TXT we looked at together may happen elsewhere too, no huge deal but worth looking into it).\n",
    "3. Once you’ve finalized the downloading process, let’s start with a very simple exercise on the TXT files. For each TXT of each company, write a code that counts the number of times the following keywords are mentioned: PROTOTYPE, TEST, EXPERIMENT, MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT, BETA, ALPHA. This is just a start, we’ll do more of this, but let’s see how this goes. You can then input this data into an Excel file (one row per company).\n",
    " \n",
    "If possible, please write your Python code clearly and upload it. So I can try to take a look.\n",
    " \n",
    "Please remember to submit your timesheet by Thursday night each week. Let’s try to meet week after Spring break, I am very flexible. Of course, please reach out if you have any questions at any point.\n",
    "Thanks so much!\n",
