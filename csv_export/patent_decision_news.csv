"At Age 46, it’s Time to Retire Benson - IPWatchdog.com",http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/09/08/time-retire-benson/id=100812/,"
There Are Two Types of § 101 Rejections
The first type of analysis is whether a man-made something is patent-eligible under § 101 by virtue of the definitions recited in 35 U. S. C. § 100.  An example of such an analysis is found in In re Nuijten, 500 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that an electromagnetic carrier per se is not a process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter a defined by § 100).  In re Nuijten reflects an example of a man-made invention that, as a categorical rule (not categorical exception), falls outside § 101.  See also, Digitech Image Techs., LLC v. Elecs. for Imaging, Inc., 758 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that data in its ethereal, non-physical form is information that does not fall under any category of eligible subject matter).  Preemption is not a factor in this type of analysis.
The second type of analysis, which was addressed in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014) is a determination of whether a claim constitutes an exception to § 101 by preempting a law of nature, natural phenomena or an “abstract idea.”  The Alice Corp. decision commands courts to construe the abstract idea narrowly noting that the non-abstract “[poses] no comparable risk of pre-emption[.]” Alice Corp., 573 S. Ct. at 2355.
This article is directed to the first type of analysis.
Congress, Not the Supreme Court, Determines the Scope of Patent Eligibility
Article I, Section 8, of the United States Constitution states “Congress shall have power . . . to promote the progress of science and useful arts” (emphasis added).
To this end, Congress enacted several different acts over time including the 1952 Patent Act.
Arguably, the two most significant changes of the 1952 Patent Act were: (1) to codify the holding of Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 250 (1850), so as to define the word “invention” in terms of nonobviousness under 35 U. S. C. § 103; and (2) to replace the word “act” under then 35 U. S. C. § 31 to “process” under § 101 while defining the word “process” in § 100.
Section 101 states: “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor . . . ” (emphasis added).  Relevant to the word “process,” Congress defined the word in § 100 (b) as follows: “The term ‘process’ means process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material” (emphasis added).
While it is fully within the courts’ powers to identify exceptions under § 101, it is not within the courts’ powers to de facto rewrite or ignore a single word of the statutory patent laws, or to replace congressional intent with biases that the courts feel better suited to patent law.  That is, it is not within the constitutional powers of the courts to place a single additional burden on patentability that Congress did not sanction in its statutes.
While courts may interpret particular words in view of congressional intent, the Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that “[u]nless otherwise defined, ‘words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.’” Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 603 (2010).  There is no known meaning “of the definitional terms ‘process, art or method’ that would require these terms to be tied to a machine or to transform an article.” Id.   “Our task . . . is the narrow one of determining what Congress meant by the words it used in the statute; once that is done, our powers are exhausted.” Diamond v. Chakrabaty, 447 U. S. 303, 318 (1980).
Turning to the idea of the ordinary, contemporary and common meaning of the word “process,” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) at p. 1205 defines “process” generally as “a series of actions, motions or occurrences . . . whereby result or effect is produced.”  As related to patent law, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “process” to mean: (1) an “art or method by which any particular result is produced;” (2) a “means or method employed to produce a certain result or effect;” and (3) “a definite combination of new or old elements, ingredients, operations, ways, or means to produce a new, improved or old result[.]”  Compare the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Electrical and Computer Engineering (2004) (ISBN0-17-144210-3) at p. 448, which defines the term as “a program that is running on a computer.”
Clearly, all applicable definitions are broad enough to include software operating in a computer, and a categorical rule differentiating software from other forms of processes is improper.  Such “categorical rule[s] denying patent protection for ‘inventions in areas not contemplated by Congress . . . would frustrate the purposes of the patent law.’” Bilski, 561 U.S. at. 605 (citing Chakrabarty).
The ‘Process’ Analysis in Gottshalk v. Benson Is Erroneous and Moot
The 1952 Patent Act was enacted in response to the anti-patent sentiment of the Supreme Court starting in the 1930s.  This anti-patent sentiment was reported by Karl Lutz (Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. XXXV, No. 3 at pp. 156-7 (March 1953)), who stated the 1952 Patent Act was enacted to remove “the recent apostasy” of the Supreme Court “from the benevolent policy of the Constitution.”  Indeed, the “apostasy” pre-1952 was so harsh that Justice Jackson criticized the Supreme Court’s “strong passion” for striking patents down “so that the only patent that is valid is one which this Court has not been able to get its hands on.” Jungersen v. Ostby & Barton Co., 335 U. S. 560, 572 (1949).
Unfortunately, anti-patent sentiment re-established itself in the 1970s as is evidenced by Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63 (1972).
There were two separate theories of patent ineligibility in Benson.  The first theory is whether or not software was a “process” under § 101.  The second theory is whether or not Benson’s claims preempted the abstract idea of Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to binary conversion.
Unfortunately, Benson’s “process” analysis had no nexus to the plain, contemporary and ordinary meaning of the word “process,” but was instead determined using erroneous criteria, such as the USPTO’s inability to address a new technology.  “The Patent Office now cannot examine applications for programs because of a lack of a classification technique and the requisite search files.” Benson, 409 U.S. at 72.  “Even if these were available, reliable searches would not be feasible or economic because of the tremendous volume of prior art being generated.” Id.  “Without this search, the patenting of programs would be tantamount to mere registration and the presumption of validity would be all but nonexistent.”  Id.  “If these programs are to be patentable,  considerable problems are raised . . . .”  Id. at 73.
In sum, the 1972 Supreme Court mistook the USPTO’s incompetency to address an emergent technology for the ordinary, contemporary and plain meaning of the term “process.”
Turning to the present day, in answer to Benson’s laments, the existence of Technology Centers 2100 (Computer Architecture Software and Information Security) and 2400 (Computer Networks, Multiplex, Cable and Cryptography/Security) provide strong evidence that the USPTO recognizes that computer programs are processes.  Further, the modern patent classification system, which includes: (1) Class 341 (Coded Data Generation or Conversion); (2) Class 700 (Data Processing: Generic control or specific applications); and (3) Class 705 (Data Processing: Financial, business Practice, Management, or Cost/Price Determinations), provides further verification that the USPTO recognizes that computer programs are processes.
Of particular and relevant interested as to whether the USPTO would today consider Benson’s claims a “process” based on the exact same criteria the Supreme Court used in 1972, one merely needs to look at class 341 / subclass 50 (digital code to digital code converters) and especially class 341 / subclass 85 (BCD (binary-coded-decimal) to binary).
There’s a bit of irony in that, by applying Benson’s criteria to Benson, Benson isn’t Benson at age 46.
Thus, whether or not the preemption issue in Benson was correctly decided, the criteria used by the 1972 Supreme Court to determine whether software is a process under § 101 shows that the Benson holding is moot.  Regardless, it is past time to retire the Luddite view that software processes are any less patent-worthy than other processes because the USPTO was incapable of examining software in 1972.
The Modern Courts Consider Software a Process under § 101
Given that the Supreme Court’s anti-software theory of patent-eligibility of Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584 (1978) was certainly overturned by Diamond v. Diehr 450 U.S. 175 (1981), all that is left of the anti-software sentiment of the 1970s is Justice Steven’s dissent in Diehr.  It is of particular interest that the thrust of Justice Steven’s dissent was an attempted expansion of the “mental steps” doctrine citing three cases including In re Heritage, 150 F.2d 554 (1945); In re Shao Wen Yuan, 188 F.2d 377 (1951) and In re Bolongaro, 62 F.2d 1059 (1933).  It is debatable that these three pre-1952 decisions would survive the 1952 Patent Act given these cases were decided during the period Karl Lutz described as “the recent apostasy.”
Regardless, while different jurists within the Federal Circuit presently view the mental steps doctrine differently, the term “mental steps doctrine” intuitively implies the idea that a patent claim should never read on a human mind performing an act.  See CyberSource v. Retail Decisions, 654 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that a claimed method not tied to any machine and that could be performed entirely by the human mind was patent ineligible).  As a fundamental issue of human dignity, the human mind should be free of government-sanctioned monopolies.
However, even when a particular software claim fails to recite a computer, a machine may still be inferred depending on the specification.  “A construction that excludes all disclosed embodiments . . . is especially disfavored” (emphasis in original).  Kaneka Corp. v. Xiamen Kingdomway, 790 F.3d 1298, 1304 (2015).
Further, when a machine is found to infringe a software claim that recites no operation on a computer, there is no risk of a human mind being hindered by said claim when a complaint appropriately alleges an infringing machine.
Fortunately, Justice Steven’s attempt to interpret the “mental steps” doctrine to read on what a machine performed was rejected by the Supreme Court majority.
Unfortunately, the “mental steps” folly re-emerged in various recent cases, such as Electric Power Group v. Alstom, 830 F.3d. 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016), which asserted that presumably novel and non-obvious machines were patent ineligible because they were somehow “mental processes.”  More specifically, Electric Power Group stated “we have treated analyzing information by steps people go through in their minds, or by mathematical algorithms, without more, as essentially mental processes within the abstract-idea category.”  Id. at 1354.
However, as shown in Electric Power Group Doc. 24 (Appellant’s opening brief), pages 27-28, a computer system (claim 1) performing specific steps was asserted against Alstom.  A machine is no human mind.  Machines don’t perform “mental steps.”  Further, the method of claim 12 is far beyond the capacity for a human mind due to the sub-second processing requirement.
Undoubtedly, any math-based algorithm can be implemented using computers.  So what?  As stated above, the exact text of § 100 (b) states that the term process “includes a new use of a known . . . machine.”  Assuming that an algorithm is novel and nonobvious, such algorithm constitutes a new use for a known machine and is therefore patent eligible based on the laws that Congress enacted.  Any other position de facto writes out statutory language of § 100 that the courts are obligated to follow.
Further, this issue was settled en banc on May 31, 2018, in Aatrix v. Green Shades, Appeal No. 2017-1452 (Fed. Cir. 2018), where steps performed by software programs that provided no improvement to any machine were considered within the realm of patent-eligible claims by Judges Prost, Newman, Lourie, Dyk, Moore, O’Malley, Wallach, Taranto, Chen, Hughes and Stoll.
Whether or not software per se is intangible, software processes are still “processes” under § 101 – especially when such software directs the actions of physical machines.  A computer is no less a machine than the wheel.  However, what jurists would assert that a new and nonobvious use for a wheel is not patent eligible?
Categorically Denying Software Claims Produces Bizarre Outcomes
To illustrate the absurdity of Benson’s anti-software position, the following examples of patented machines are provided.
First, contrary to popular notion, U.S. Patent No. 4,344,142 to James Diehr was not the first attempt to patent the idea of performing a real-time simulation of the Arrhenius equation using periodic temperature measurements of a rubber mold in order to cure rubber.  In fact, nearly two years prior to Diehr’s filing, Thomas Smith filed for a device that performed the very same algorithm using dedicated logic, which was granted as U.S. Patent No. 3,819,915. Smith was also granted U.S. Patent No. 4,022,555 for another rubber-curing device based on discrete logic.
Similarly, William Claxton filed for patent protection in 1974 for an Arrhenius-based rubber-curing device using analog components, which issued as U.S. Patent No. 4,044,600.
The point is simple.
On the day Diehr was argued before the Supreme Court, there were no less than four machines of various designs that performed the exact same rubber-curing processes based on a real-time operation of the Arrhenius equation.  However, only one design evoked the Bensonesque anti-software / “mental steps” nonsensical theory whereby software operating within a machine negated patent eligibility in the minds of a minority of jurists.
The Benson decision may only be 46, but it needs to be retired.  It’s a parasite to the patent community, and an embarrassment that the Supreme Court refuses to admit is an embarrassment.
As a last note – without doubt technological advances on mind-machine interfaces will one day require new tests to determine patent eligibility under the “mental steps” doctrine.  Those will be fun times.

Smartflash Petitions Supreme Court to Challenge PTAB under Appointments Clause - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/09/16/smartflash-files-petition-writ-supreme-court-challenge-ptab-appointments-clause/id=101366/,"
In early August, patent owner Smartflash filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal a case stemming from covered business method (CBM) review proceedings carried out at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Smartflash is asking the Supreme Court to decide whether PTAB administrative patent judges (APJs) are principal officers of the United States who are subject to the terms of the Appointment Clause, whether CBM review of patents disclosed prior to passage of the America Invents Act (AIA) violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and whether undisputed evidence that an invention is not unduly preemptive is relevant to answer questions of patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101.
At issue in this petition are a total of 30 CBM reviews petitioned by Apple, Samsung and Google against Smartflash, which were instituted by APJ panels at the PTAB. Although the APJ panels in these cases found that petitioners did not establish a likelihood that Smartflash’s patent claims were invalid under on 35 U.S.C. § 102 grounds for novelty or 35 U.S.C. § 103 grounds for obviousness, they did find a likelihood that the patent claims were invalid on Section 101 grounds for being directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. In the CBM reviews, the PTAB panels applied the two-part Alice test to determine first that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of conditioning and controlling access to content based upon payment, and then second that the additional elements of the claims did not contain an inventive step, thus rendering the claims invalid under Section 101. Smartflash appealed the PTAB’s final written decisions and the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 affirmance upholding the PTAB’s decisions without an opinion.

In its petition for writ, Smartflash argues that the authority vested in APJs to invalidate issued patents without review by any other Executive Branch employee renders APJs as principal officers of the U.S. government. As principal officers, and thus subject to the Appointments Clause, Smartflash argues that APJs must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Various aspects of the APJ position points to their role as officers of the U.S. and not mere employees of the federal government including their career positions created by statute, their presiding over adversarial trial-type proceedings and their power to sanction parties for misconduct.
Smartflash’s petition raises the subject of panel stacking in the context of discussing the mechanisms which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Director has to influence the outcome of PTAB proceedings. The stacking of APJ panels to achieve policy outcomes desired by the USPTO Director was admitted by counsel representing the USPTO before the Federal Circuit back in 2015. “Ignoring for the moment the serious due process questions [panel stacking] raises,” Smartflash notes that the authority to designate APJs to panels is not the kind of authority that would characterize APJs as officers inferior to the director. Supreme Court precedent from Freytag v. Commissioner (1991) and Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission (2018) compel the conclusion that APJs are officers of the United States.
Although Smartflash’s petition for writ does not raise this issue, the assignment of APJs in its CBM review cases raises serious questions of ethics, not just constitutionality. As we reported last April, one of the APJs assigned to multiple CBM review panels petitioned by Apple to challenge Smartflash’s patents had a previous work relationship with Apple and counsel representing Apple which would have necessitated that judge to recuse himself if he were a judge deciding the case in an Article III district court.
Smartflash also argues that the Supreme Court should also take up this case to determine if CBM reviews retroactively applied to patents filed prior to the AIA, which enacted the PTAB and CBM review, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This was a grounds for challenging the constitutionality of the PTAB that was expressly left open by the Court’s decision earlier this year in Oil States v. Greene’s Energy Group. “Subjecting Smartflash’s patents to a new form of agency review impairs the value of Smartflash’s property in a way that is fundamentally unfair,” the petition reads. At the time that Smartflash applied for its patents, the only procedures in place at the USPTO to challenge the validity of those patents were ex parte examination and inter partes reexamination. CBM review carries a much higher risk of invalidation than those other two procedures and thus substantially reduces the value of patents. Apple challenged the validity of Smartflash’s patents multiple times on Section 101 grounds during the district court litigation but didn’t prevail, leading to a $532 million verdict for Smartflash. Without the AIA and CBM review, the only way that Apple would have been able to continue its challenge on Section 101 grounds would have been appeal to the Federal Circuit; Section 101 grounds can’t be raised in a reexamination.
Finally, Smartflash argues that the PTAB’s application of the Alice test to determine patent validity under Section 101 erred in failing to consider evidence that Smartflash’s patents didn’t tie up building blocks of future innovation. “On the contrary, respondents’ experts repeatedly admitted that there are a variety of ways to implement the alleged abstract idea of conditioning and controlling access to content based on payment,” the petition reads. Citing to the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, Smartflash notes that the Alice inquiry “is aimed at ensuring that a patent will not ‘’inhibit further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of’ the[] building blocks of human ingenuity.’” While the Federal Circuit has applied the framework in a way that rejects the need to show undue preemption to find invalidity under Section 101, possibly due to an application of precedence set in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories (2012) holding that federal courts are not well-suited to make the determination that an invention is unduly preemptive, such a rationale shouldn’t hold sway at the PTAB where APJs are hired in large part because of their scientific knowledge.
Apple and Samsung jointly filed a brief in opposition of Smartflash’s petition for writ which begins by stating that, although Smartflash owns patents covering methods, systems and devices for controlling access to data based on payment, “Smartflash does not practice these patents or make any products.” Conveniently, this statement ignores the fact that Smartflash inventor Patrick Racz did attempt to commercialize his technology before his technology was stolen by a European electronics design firm whose head of R&D was later hired by Apple to support the company’s digital rights management (DRM) development. Apple’s focus on Smartflash’s business model has encouraged the court of public opinion to tar Smartflash as a patent troll and it’s worth noting that the district court granted a motion in limine filed by Smartflash which precluded Apple from making any argument or providing testimony that “Smartflash [is] a shell company” or from making “any insinuation that any… aspects of Smartflash’s corporate structure are suspicious or improper.”

"Gust, Inc. v. AlphaCap Ventures, LLC (Fed. Cir. 2018) | McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff LLP - JDSupra",http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/gust-inc-v-alphacap-ventures-llc-fed-86330/,"


	Almost two years ago, we covered a dispute in the Southern District of New York (which began in the Eastern District of Texas) involving plaintiff AlphaCap, a non-practicing entity that aggressively asserted its patents against a number of targets, including Gust.  In short, when Gust didn't quickly settle, AlphaCap offered to dismiss its claims.  But Gust wanted AlphaCap to pay its attorneys' fees or assign AlphaCap the patents.  After some back-and-forth between the parties, the District Court dismissed the case but awarded Gust attorneys' fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285.  Gutride Safier LLP, attorneys for AlphaCap, were held jointly and severally liable for these fees and costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1927.

	Notably, the District Court stated that the case was ""exceptional"" under § 285 because the Supreme Court's Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l opinion ""gave AlphaCap clear notice that the AlphaCap Patents could not survive scrutiny under 35 U.S.C. § 101.""  The basis of this conclusion was that ""the claims were directed to crowdfunding, a fundamental economic concept and way of organizing human activity, and that this was an abstract idea.""  The District Court further held that ""the claims did not include an inventive concept sufficient to render the abstract ideas patent eligible under Alice.""

	Regarding § 1927, the District Court found Gutride to have acted unreasonably and in bad faith during the dispute, because it was unwilling to recommend settlement ""despite knowing that Alice doomed the claims and stating that the case was 'not worth litigating'.""

	Gutride brought this appeal to the Federal Circuit solely on the issue of its liability for the attorneys' fees.  Judge Linn wrote the opinion of the Court and was joined by Judge Hughes.  Judge Wallach dissented.

The Majority Opinion

	28 U.S.C. § 1927 states:

	Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.

	Applying the law of the Second Circuit, a successful motion under § 1927 requires that: (i) the case was ""entirely without color"", and (ii) was ""brought in bad faith—that is, motivated by improper purposes such as harassment or delay.""  These determinations require a court to ""provide a high degree of specificity in the factual findings.""

	Addressing the first prong, the Gutride referenced the ""unsettled state of the law following the decision in Alice"" as evidence that its case had color.  Gust responded by contending that ""the § 101 law post-Alice was settled, because all cases dealing with abstract ideas in patents cited the two-step Alice framework,"" and that ""the claims here were not even questionably patent eligible.""

	The Federal Circuit agreed with Gutride, noting that there was a ""relative paucity of § 101 cases that were decided by this court between Alice and AlphaCap's complaint in Texas.""  Indeed, several of the Federal Circuit's own cases from this time period ""recognized the uncertainty in the application of Alice.""  The Court further observed that ""[w]hen the applicable law is unsettled, attorneys may not be sanctioned merely for making reasonable arguments for interpreting the law.""  Instead, ""it is particularly important to allow attorneys the latitude necessary to challenge and thus solidify the legal rules without the chill of direct economic sanctions.""  Also, according to the Court, Gutride made a colorable argument that the claims met the requirements of § 101 due to being analogous to DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com L.P., while Gust's analogy between the claims and those found ineligible in another Southern District of New York case was unpersuasive.  Finally, the Court strongly disagreed with Gust that the mere existence of the two-step Alice framework implied that § 101 law was settled, and found the District Court's patent-eligibility analysis to be conclusory.

	When applying the second prong, the District Court concluded that Gutride's actions constituted bad faith based on three grounds: (i) ""Gutride knew that AlphaCap's patents were not patent eligible after Alice, and initiated the litigation anyway to extract a nuisance settlement""; (ii) Gutride's opposition to transferring the case to the Southern District of New York; and (iii) ""Gutride's failure to end the case through settlement, dismissal, or a covenant not to sue.""

	Regarding Gutride's alleged knowledge that the patents were not eligible, the District Court put a fair amount of weight on Gutride's statement that ""the case is 'not worth litigating'.""  But the Federal Circuit viewed this statement as a negotiating position, noting that ""[i]n the context of advocating for settlement with the opposing party to settle, this is an inoffensive assertion that the calculus favors settlement, not an admission that the patents were invalid.""

	With respect to the nuisance settlement, the Federal Circuit was more sympathetic.  It acknowledged that ""AlphaCap bears relatively little risk and cost in filing its infringement actions, as compared with the relatively high costs incurred by defendants to defend the lawsuit.""  Thus, by ""encouraging quick settlements at values far below the cost of defending an infringement action on the merits, AlphaCap was able to obtain not insignificant revenues without having to test the merits of its position.""  Nonetheless, the Court found that ""Rule 11, with its procedural safeguards, already addresses attorneys' complicity in the filing of frivolous and improper litigation"" and that ""§ 1927 only applies to actions that result in unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of proceedings.""  Consequently, the Court ruled with Gutride on this issue.

	The Court also sided with Gutride regarding its resistance to the transfer.  Driving this conclusion was the fact that the Eastern District of Texas was a proper venue, that Gust had agreed to venue discovery, and because ""at least some third-party users were found to reside in the Eastern District of Texas.""  Supporting these points, the Court observed that ""an attorney need not bring a case in the most convenient forum, but only a proper forum.""

	Finally, the Court also agreed with Gutride that failure to settle is not evidence of bad faith.  Notably, ""[t]he decision to settle or grant a covenant not to sue is wholly committed to clients, not their attorneys.""  Thus, Gutride could not be held liable for its client's decision.

	For these reasons, the Court sided with Gutride and reversed the award of fees under § 1927.

Judge Wallach's Dissent

	Writing in dissent, Judge Wallach faulted the majority for reversing the District Court.  A significant part of Judge Wallach's beef was based on the § 101 issues.  He disagreed that the law regarding patent-eligibility was unsettled, stating it was that ""the framework with which we have consistently assessed patent eligibility under § 101 since its rendering.""

	Attacking the claims, Judge Wallach found them ""directed to data organization and use of customizable profiles to facilitate patronage,"" which in his view were clearly abstract ideas.  While the majority found that § 101 jurisprudence as a whole was evolving, Judge Wallach stated that no claims similar to AlphaCap's were determined eligible by the Federal Circuit during the litigation.  In his words:

	The Asserted Claims merely recite a series of steps for storing and organizing investment data that could all be performed by humans without a computer, and Gutride's attempt to assert otherwise was frivolous given that the abstract idea here is not meaningfully different from the ideas found to be abstract in other cases before the Supreme Court and our court involving methods of organizing human activity.

	He also found additional elements lacking an inventive concept under Alice, as they were all involving conventional and generic terms.  Thus, with respect to § 101 as a whole, Judge Wallach concluded that ""[t]he Patents-in-Suit clearly do not fall in that interstitial area where doubt may reasonably exist.""  Judge Wallach was silent regarding the fact that he and the majority coming to two different conclusions when applying Alice to the claims suggests that the law surrounding § 101 is still unsettled.

	Determining that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that AlphaCap's case lacked a colorable basis, Judge Wallach moved on to bad faith.

	Particularly, he found no flaw in the District Court's assessment of Gutride being ""motivated by improper purposes such as harassment or delay.""  He did not address the majority's position that Rule 11 controlled, and instead found ""we must holistically consider Gutride's entire course of conduct in order to determine if it acted in bad faith by delaying dismissal of its suit, when it had knowledge of the suit's frivolous nature.""  Further, he found that the ""not worth litigating"" statement occurred early enough in the case that Gutride could have pushed to settle the dispute much earlier.  Judge Wallach saw this as a ""bad faith attempt to multiply the proceedings.""

	Turning to venue, Judge Wallach pointed to evidence that Gutride claimed that Gust had ties to the Eastern District of Texas, could not establish that said ties existed, and only after discovery was able to show that Gust had some users in the district.  This, apparently, was enough for Gutride to fail the bad faith sniff test.

	Consequently, Judge Wallach would have affirmed the District Court.

Analysis

	Regarding overly-aggressive litigation and the venue issue, Gutride may have indeed pushed the envelope.  On whether its conduct rises to the level of bad faith, the majority was probably correct to err on the side of caution.  Judge Wallach, on the other hand, gave more deference to the District Court.

	But the majority was clearly correct to conclude that § 101 jurisprudence was too murky during the time of the litigation (early 2015 – late 2016) to conclude that AlphaCap's case was without color.

	In 2015, the Federal Circuit found no claims patent-eligible under § 101.  But this does not imply that all business method and software claims involving data manipulation were categorically ineligible -- it merely suggests that the Court did not hear a case with claims that passed the test.  Also, not long prior to this time frame, there were multiple federal judges commenting on the record that Alice was hard to apply in practice.  Judge Wu of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California criticized Alice for setting forth an ""I know it when I see it"" test.  Judge Pfaelzer, a colleague of Judge Wu, wrote that the Supreme Court's patent-eligibility cases ""often confuse more than they clarify [and] appear to contradict each other on important issues.""

	More recently, Judge Wallach's Federal Circuit colleague, Judge Plager, wrote that the post-Alice §101 inquiry ""renders it near impossible to know with any certainty whether the invention is or is not patent eligible.""  And these are just a few examples of judicial confusion.  There are more.  The law was not settled during the case, and is even less settled now.

	Thus, it is hard to agree with Judge Wallach.  Moreover, with a § 101 challenge being routinely raised against any asserted software or business method patent, the impact of penalizing plaintiffs and their attorneys for exercising such a patent would be to shut off nearly all software or business method litigation.

	That is not to say that bad actors should not be punished.  But contending that § 101 is settled law to do so is absurd.  The only thing settled about patent-eligibility in the last four years is that it is unsettled.

Capitol Hill Roundup - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/09/17/capitol-hill-roundup/id=101431/,"
This week in Capitol Hill hearings, it will be a relatively light week all around, and particularly so for those who focus on intellectual property, technology and innovation. Indeed, there are few hearings on tap for the week that might be of interest. Nevertheless, financial services innovation, health care cost reductions will be discussed in the Senate on Tuesday.
Tuesday, September 18th
Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions – Reducing Health Care Costs: Examining How Transparency Can Lower Spending and Empower Patients
At 10:00 AM on Tuesday. No hearing notice. In early August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a final rule that increases price transparency for patients by requiring hospitals to post standard charges for hospital services on the Internet in a machine-readable format. The rule also maintains a requirement for health care providers to incorporate certified electronic health record technology including application programming interfaces (APIs) that can enable patients to collect medical records from multiple providers through a single portal. The hearing’s witness panel includes representatives from The Leapfrog Group of Washington, DC; Healthcare Bluebook of Nashville, TN; Washington Health Alliance of Seattle, WA; and St. George Surgical Center of St. George, UT. The hearing will take place in 430 Dirksen Senate Office Building.
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs – Fintech: Examining Digitization, Data, and Technology
At 10:00 AM on Tuesday. No hearing notice. Financial technologies such as cryptocurrency and mobile banking via smartphones are designed to improve the delivery of financial services through innovative means. Fintech systems have been developed to automate various financial services such as trading, insurance and risk management, although patentability in the financial technology sector has been hampered in recent years by the introduction of covered business method (CBM) review proceedings at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) as well as the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The hearing’s witness panel will include representatives from Allon Advocacy on behalf of Consumer Data Financial Rights, Fidelity Wealth Technologies, the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and Cornell University. The hearing will take place in 538 Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Farm victim of ‘patent troll’ lawsuit - Business - Capital Press,http://www.capitalpress.com/Business/20180912/farm-victim-of-patent-troll-lawsuit,"An Oregon farm that sells organic foods and other products online is accused of patent infringement in a “patent troll” lawsuit.





Capital Press File
David Stelzer, CEO of Azure Farms near Dufur, Ore. The farm, which sells organic foods and other goods online, has been targeted by a company that regularly accuses other companies of patent infringement.

The vaguely threatening letter over alleged patent infringement that Azure Farms received last year didn’t make much of an impression on David Stelzer.Stelzer, the company’s founder and CEO, consulted with his information technology employees, who assumed the letter was a scam.“I didn’t give it a second thought,” he said.Now, the Oregon company is the defendant in a lawsuit that alleges its online website for selling organic food and other products has violated a patent for automated financial transactions owned by Landmark Technology LLC of San Diego, Calif.Stelzer said his website isn’t much different from multitudes of others that sell products online, making him think the plaintiff has filed a “nuisance lawsuit” aimed at a quick settlement.Azure Farms, based in Dufur, Ore., doesn’t have deep pockets to hire expensive attorneys, which is perhaps why the company was targeted, he said.“I have no clue what they are after,” said Stelzer, who farms nearly 2,000 acres. “They’re basically saying because we have a working website, we have patent violations.”According to the complaint, Azure Farms’ website contains numerous functions protected by a patent issued in 2001 that the company should be enjoined from further violating. Landmark Technology also seeks damages for past infringement in an amount to be proven at trial.“It would be difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation that would afford Landmark adequate relief for such future and continuing acts, and a multiplicity of judicial proceedings would be required,” the complaint said.John Mansfield, attorney for Landmark Technology, referred questions to his boss, Bill Charters, who wasn’t available for comment as of press time.Azure Farms isn’t alone in its quandary.Landmark Technology has been involved in about 170 federal lawsuits — mostly as a plaintiff, but occasionally as a defendant against companies seeking a “declaratory judgment” that they haven’t committed patent infringement, according to court records.In one such case, the Fabletics online clothing company called Landmark Technology a “patent troll” whose “business model is sending letters threatening patent litigation and following through on that threat.” The lawsuit has since settled for undisclosed terms.Most such litigation settles fairly quickly due to cost pressures, rather than the merit of the allegations, said Daniel Nazer, senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that defends “civil liberties in the digital world.”Even the simplest patent lawsuit is rarely litigated through trial for less than $1 million, while bigger cases commonly cost more than $10 million, Nazer said.“Patent litigation is sometimes called the sport of kings,” he said. “They tend to be complicated cases with experts and a lot of document discovery.”While it’s technically possible for companies that successfully defend themselves against such lawsuits to recover attorney fees, that outcome is rare enough that many defendants don’t take the chance, Nazer said.The problem would be mitigated if the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declined to approve patents for overly broad claims, he said. “Generally, we think the patent office needs to do a better job of policing obviousness and not giving patents to mundane business processes on a computer.”“Non-practicing entities” — the official name for companies that do nothing but sue over patents — have been dealt a couple legal setbacks in recent years, said David Donoghue, a patent trial attorney with the Holland & Knight law firm.In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that enshrining a conventional business transaction in computer code wasn’t enough to make the method eligible for a patent in a case known as Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank.In 2011, the America Invents Act was signed into law, allowing defendants in such cases to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reconsider the validity of a disputed patent, said Donoghue.This administrative process of “inter partes review,” or IPR, is less expensive than traditional lawsuits, which are often stayed while the agency deliberates, he said.These two changes haven’t entirely prevented complaints seeking to extract license fees because defendants still often prefer to settle, Donoghue said.Even so, the value of dubious patents has been reduced, so the financial “sweet spot” of settling such cases has also fallen, he said.The phenomenon remains troubling for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, since such lawsuits effectively penalize companies like Azure Farms from stepping up their online marketing, Nazer said.“It disincentivizes people from being entrepreneurial,” he said.

Alice at Age Four: Time to Grow Up - IPWatchdog.com,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/09/18/alice-age-four-grow-up/id=101447/,"
To be successful, patent practitioners must show the PTO, courts, and Congress the importance of our clients’ innovations and explain why the type of technology should not dictate whether there is enforceability.

In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued the now much-maligned Alice decision, which ostensibly provided guidance on patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The decision was obtuse and capable of many different interpretations.
Four years later, the patent landscape demonstrates that Alice has become a train wreck for innovation. This article looks at the damage wrought by litigants and trial courts in applying flawed interpretations of Alice, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s abdication, at least until recently, of its responsibility to interpret Alice.
Court in the Crosshairs
It was no surprise that the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Alice. By 2013, the Federal Circuit clearly had been struggling to provide guidance on what types of inventions should be patent-eligible. Upon grant of en banc review in Alice, the Federal Circuit specifically asked the parties and amici curiae, “What test should the court adopt to determine whether a computer-implemented invention is a patent-ineligible abstract idea?” However, its en banc decision completely failed to establish such a test — much less provide unified guidance. Instead, the Court issued a per curiam opinion accompanied by six other opinions.[1] Certiorari was close to inevitable.
The rest, of course, we know too well. The Supreme Court determined that patent claims drawn to a computer-implemented scheme for mitigating financial “settlement risk” were not patent-eligible under Section 101. But it was not the High Court’s judgment of “not patent-eligible” that so disrupted the innovating community. It was the subsequent warped interpretations of Court’s opaque analysis.
Armed with Alice, infringement defendants successfully convinced district courts to use the Alice decision’s alleged “teachings,” found in loose language, to suffocate patent infringement cases before they even got started—by invalidating patents on the pleadings. Such pleadings invalidations became rampant despite long-standing procedural rules and patent doctrines that taught against them, not the least of which was the presumption of patent validity.
Patent cases are notoriously complicated and difficult to resolve. Sadly, Alice’s novel allure of an early dismissal enticed the district courts time and again to ignore established practices. Alice allowed judges to blithely bypass unpacking specific statutory sections, avoid application of patent precedent to complicated technologies, and ignore interpretation of patent claim terms.
The Resulting Carnage
Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit failed to rein in this rout of Machiavellian creativity, which it could have done by relying on well-settled procedural process and patent doctrines. Once a district court succeeded in invalidating an entire patent without considering the claims or the underlying technology, the Federal Circuit refused to correct the wrong for the hundreds of litigants appealing those lower court dismissals. In most cases, the Court declined to craft any sort of explanatory opinion, relying instead on its ability to issue a one-word decision – “Affirmed.”[2]
After four years, over 90% of cases appealed to the Federal Circuit on patent ineligibility grounds have been affirmed.  Ninety percent. As of the end of August 2018, the Federal Circuit has reversed or vacated only 9.[3],[4]
Upstream of the Federal Circuit, since Alice, over 810 district court decisions have addressed patent eligibility. Of those 810, around 480 decisions, or about 60% percent, found claims unpatentable under Section 101.[5]  Of those 480 invalidations, 355 of them, or about 74% resulted from a Motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or 12(c).[6]  Think about these numbers: in a scant four years, 355 district court decisions have invalidated patents just on a pleading, without looking into what PHOSITA would think, much less conducting a claim construction.
How does this happen when a patent is presumed valid? And, when factual issues under Rule 12 are supposed to be resolved in favor of the patentee? I cannot imagine what Judge Giles Rich would be thinking now, as his thorough and nuanced approach to establishing clear patent precedent has been thrown aside by recent jurisprudence.
And let’s take one closer look. Of those more than 480 district court patent invalidations under Section 101, there have been only 122 appellate decisions. Only about 25 percent of the district court invalidations continued to appellate decision before the expert Federal Circuit.[7]
In other words, simply by filing a patent infringement complaint, over half the time, the patentee not only lost the litigation, but also lost its patent right, and 75% of those losses were not appealed.  If those numbers don’t confirm the benefits of efficient infringement, I’m not sure what does.
Of that lucky 25% that had the resources to request Federal Circuit review, fewer than one-half of them, or 57 of the 122 appeals of district court invalidations, received opinions from the Federal Circuit.[8]The rest received the dreaded “Rule 36 Affirmance,” which provides no guidance to the litigants or to others trying to navigate these dangerous waters.[9]
Even today, the Federal Circuit’s post-Alice decisions tell us that no financial patent is safe from Section 101. And, if you can believe it, no Federal Circuit decision has defined what “abstract” means, even though courts have invalidated several hundred patents as being “abstract.”[10]
It is also clear that Alice has affected how software and financial applications are handled at the Patent Office, which has issued three Guidances trying to unravel Alice.[11]Even so, it remains difficult to know how to draft an application that will militate against a Section 101 rejection. In the Patent Office’s technology group 705 for example, the rejection rate remains above 90%.[12]
While these statistics are relatively easy to determine, the upstream shift in how or whether innovation will be developed and protected is more difficult to quantify and much more far-reaching.
Glimmers of Hope?
This year, the Federal Circuit appears finally to have awakened from its slumber. In two recent opinions, Aatrix v. Green Shades and Berkheimer v. HP, the Federal Circuit embraced long-established procedural rules and patent doctrines.  Recognizing first that there may be underlying factual determinations in patent eligibility, especially when a patent is presumed valid, and also, that a motion to dismiss on the pleadings fails if the non-movant raises factual discrepancies.[13]
These two recent cases along with various building blocks provided by the few other Federal Circuit decisions, provide a tinge of silver around the edges of the dark cloud cast by Alice, providing hope that once again, we can develop sensible, cogent precedent for district courts and the PTO to follow on Section 101.
This is no fairy tale.[14] Rebuilding the innovation landscape and providing the proper scope of protection for software and financial innovations will take time and focused efforts by those who can effect such change.
There is movement in Congress to amend Section 101. Several legislative proposals attempt to avoid the innovation mire, but they are complicated and face resistance – not least due to the relative unfamiliarity to many in Congress of the complexities of patent law and the harm that has resulted from Alice. It’s worth noting that in our current, volatile climate on the Hill, amendments to patent -eligibility may not be the most pressing matters on the minds of our members of Congress.
While Congress grinds away, however, the Federal Circuit should be able to continue to clarify precedent under the current statute. Section 101 did not hinder innovation until courts tried to give it teeth that don’t fit its jaws. With Berkheimer and Aatrix, maybe we begin to move into a more stable environment.
Section 101 requires simply that: “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.” Judge Rich aptly interpreted the Patent Statute as having a gatekeeping function, with Section 101 the first of several doors that must be opened. The Supreme Court has repeatedly issued similarly broad teachings on eligibility, as covering “anything under the sun that is made by man.”[15] Nothing has changed in the wording of the statute since the 1980s, only the warped, astigmatic, anti-innovation lens we are bringing to it.
Certainly, technology has evolved: coding and applications of algorithms, development of genetic modifications, and diagnostic treatments. But these technological developments are no different in their newness from from earlier developments that Section 101 handled, such as “practical applications for mathematical formula.”[16]
The trial courts interpreting Alice have forgotten, what Judge Rich once stated masterfully: an analysis performed solely under Section 101 cannot alone impart patentability. Rather, “If the invention … falls into any one of the named categories [in Section 101], [the inventor] is allowed to pass through [the door of Section 101] to the second door, which is § 102; ‘novelty and loss of right to patent’ is the sign on it.”[17] Of course, the inventor also must pass through a third door: “obviousness and loss of patent right” is the sign on that third one.
Determining patentability by invoking a series of doors, of which patent eligibility is merely the first, reflects a progression in logical order. By ignoring these three separate doors, courts post-Alice have forgotten the separate, sequential requirements of the patent statute found in Sections 101, 102, and 103, opting instead to conflate all of those requirements into an overburdened Section 101 alone. Thus, it has caused confusion not only in the law but also for the innovators in our economy. Confusion stalls innovation, because complexity and costs increase for inventors, while incentives correspondingly decrease.
What To Do?
With Congress otherwise preoccupied, fighting to amend the patent statute post-AIA may not be the fastest way to stabilize the innovation economy. Instead, we need to return to a traditional analysis of what is patentable under all the sections of the statute. Rather than foisting all analysis on an overburdened Section 101, we need to return to application of tried and true procedural rules and presumptions, and continue to build useful precedent.
The Federal Circuit has started to do so, it appears, in Aatrix and Berkheimer: call it steps A and B. And going forward, practitioners must assist the Federal Circuit in filling out this alphabet, by continuing to provide the Federal Circuit, the district courts, and the PTO with the type of analyses these institutions need to rebuild the doctrine.
Consider these means to helping achieve that:

Speak Up. Many patent practitioners remain silent, adhering to the dogma that we are merely advocates for our clients. And, in truth, many of our largest companies are happy with the innovation carnage.[18] Technology giants can, and do, efficiently infringe. However, voicing your opinion on the damage being done from mistaken interpretations of Alicewill help right the course.  Educating the Courts, the PTO, and Congress about the damage that has occurred and what the correct interpretation of Section 101 should be is a valuable first step in overcoming the sweeping movement towards promoting efficient infringement.[19]
Keep Preparing and Filing Applications. Well-drafted patent applications – thoughtful and deliberate, still should prevail at the USPTO, survive challenges, and provide the building blocks for further clarifying Section 101 doctrine. The current confusion should not prevent organizations from filing patent applications on their valuable innovations. Maybe one job of the advocate is to explain to our clients the benefits of continuing to protect innovation. The law is changing at such a rapid pace that we cannot know during prosecution what will pass muster during subsequent challenge. If we don’t file, we can only fail. We do know that options, in the form of claim variations, provide more future certainty. File applications that anticipate tomorrow’s law by delivering a breadth of claims that range from the border of eligibility to something most examiners will agree today passes muster.
Inoculate Your Applications from Current Section 101 Challenges. Use recent case law as a road map to insulate your applications from being denied under too broad of an application of Section 101. Use the PTO Examination Guidance to understand how the agency reviews eligibility. Clearly disclose the benefits of the invention, the improvements over the prior art, and exactly where the innovation falls in a larger system, etc.
Prepare Infringement Complaints that Reveal Issues of Fact. Provide claim charts, highlight potential factual disputes, and attach the relevant portions of the file history if needed. Attach an expert declaration to the Complaint that explains how the accused device reads on the claim. Anticipate that Rule 12 motion — and let your complaint be the response. If a defendant has to disagree with your well-stated factual assertions, there is no basis for a Rule 12 dismissal. Of course, this type of detail is not required for notice pleading, but it is required to rebuild the confidence in the stability of Section 101. And, these types of filings, along with the resulting court decisions, also provide tools for further clarifying Section 101 doctrine.

The debacle represented by Alice is reversible over time, but the Congress, a governmental agency, and even the court system itself are not likely to resolve the challenge to innovators without the assistance of the bar and the industry. Drafting fewer but stronger patent applications will be a worthwhile start. The alternative is not acceptable.
Savvy and creative patent lawyering will prevail over time. To be successful, patent practitioners must show the PTO, the courts, and Congress the importance of our clients’ innovations and explain why the type of technology should not dictate whether there is enforceability. Please join me in this fight.

The Limitations of Lean Startup Principles,http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-limitations-of-lean-startup-principles/,"
The Lean Startup is a bestselling business book by Eric Ries that has become a global revolution with followers in 17 countries. Its principles have been adopted by early-stage ventures, Fortune 500 companies and even the U.S. government. Its core principle is to test a “minimum viable product” early and gather information to further fine-tune development. The idea is to mitigate risk in the product development process. 
But there is a downside to early market testing, according to the research paper, “Experimentation, Learning and Appropriability in Early-Stage Ventures,” by Andrea Contigiani, a researcher at the Mack Institute for Innovation Management and a Wharton doctoral candidate. By releasing early versions of products, companies risk imitation by a competitor. He spoke to Knowledge@Wharton about when early market testing can hurt more than help.
An edited transcript of the conversation follows.
Knowledge@Wharton: Why did you choose this particular topic?
Andrea Contigiani: I have always been interested in questions around innovation, so when I was choosing a topic for my dissertation, I wanted to find something that would be really impactful, that practitioners and industry people would care about.
I went out and tried to interview as many people as I could, both in the big Wharton alumni community, and also in the Philadelphia startup scene.… It was really clear that most people cared a lot about being a lean startup. Things like experimenting, creating a minimum viable product, pivoting. These were some of the things that came up most.
I was very familiar with The Lean Startup idea, but I don’t think I was fully aware of the impact that it had on business and entrepreneurship. It has really been a little bit of a revolution. The U.S. government is even asking the companies they fund to use lean startup methodology through a program called I-Corps.
The key words in Lean have really become part of the business language in all sectors, not just startups. This has really been an important change, and so I wanted to look into this topic [and validate it] with data.
Knowledge@Wharton: Just to back up a little bit, you mentioned the book, The Lean Startup. Can you explain briefly what that is for our listeners?
Contigiani: Absolutely. The Lean Startup [describes] a way to do business. It applies not only to early-stage companies, but also to everybody doing innovation including large firms, nonprofits and even governments.
The core of The Lean Startup is essentially [to do early] experimentation rather than trying to understand the details of your business, your product, before executing. The idea is to … get market feedback as soon as possible…. There are some specific practical tools that The Lean Startup suggests, primarily minimum viable product (an early stage of your product through which you can get feedback) and pivoting (changing the product after getting user feedback). These are its two big innovations. In general, this [idea] helps companies innovate more effectively. … Much of The Lean Startup [methodology] comes from the amazing work that [entrepreneurs] Steve Blank and Eric Ries have done over the past 10, 15 years.
I attended a Lean Startup conference last year in San Francisco where Eric presented his latest book, The Startup Way. The big change from his previous book … was that now he tries to teach how to do lean innovation to all kinds of firms, not just startups. [Lean principles have led to], I think, a fundamental change in business.
“The key words in Lean have really become part of the business language in all sectors, not just startups.”
Knowledge@Wharton: I understand that your research actually took those principles and went a step further. So walk us through what the goal of your research was, and what were some of the parameters of your study.
Contigiani: That was exactly what I am hoping to do with my research. [Lean comprises] an extraordinarily valuable set of ideas. I tried to take those ideas to see what the data said about them. While I really believe that Lean has some fundamental value, there are probably some of what we would call in research “boundary conditions.”
There could be situations where going lean is optimal, and other situations where it’s not, and maybe in those situations if you want to go lean you have to also take some other strategies to make that work. And so I wanted to try to understand those boundary conditions.
The first step I took … was to look at a very important concept that in the innovation academic literature has been discussed for a long time: appropriability. [With that view,] I explored, for empirical purposes, a very interesting change in the intellectual property environment in the U.S., which was [the impact of] a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2014 — Alice Corp v. CLS Bank International. (Alice made patenting in parts of the software industry, mostly business software, less effective.)
This was an important [decision] because it changed the way we thought about patents in a segment of the software industry. It affected some companies doing software, but not all companies doing software. What it did was really changed appropriability for some of the companies. Studying what companies did in that context helped us understand how appropriability plays out in experimentation.
Knowledge@Wharton: Can you explain what you mean by appropriability, and also the terms formal intellectual property, and informal intellectual property, which you mention in your paper?
Contigiani: Appropriability is one of the most important concepts that we have in the innovation academic literature. It comes out of the work of David Teece, a very well-known strategy scholar from U.C. Berkeley. A lot of work that came before and also after contributed to that [body of thought].
Appropriability is essentially the capacity a firm has to appropriate [or retain the] value from its innovation. If you are an innovator — whether you’re a large firm, small firm or inventor — when you create an innovation, the value of that could go to you or to other players in the market, depending on how the market is structured and on the strategy that you take and how the companies react. Appropriability is essentially how much of the value you can keep for yourself, how much you can appropriate.
I thought this could be an important boundary condition for experimentation for going lean. The basic hypothesis … is that when appropriability is not high [i.e., you are not clearly able to appropriate most of the value of your innovation because you have some kind of defenses in place], when you experiment you are giving out some information about your product at a time when you are still vulnerable.
You could get imitated; you could get replicated. Those processes reduce appropriability. So experimentation, if you don’t have an appropriate defensive strategy, might reduce your appropriability. Of course, a fundamental role is played by what we call intellectual property (IP). Some people would even say that IP is what defines appropriability.
“You could get imitated; you could get replicated. Those processes reduce appropriability.”
There are two important forms of intellectual property. One is what we call formal intellectual property — legal tools to protect your intellectual properties such as patents, trademarks, copyrights and to some extent trade secrecy. While some would say trade secrecy is not necessarily a formal tool … it is regulated by law. Informal intellectual property is a set of strategic tools, strategic moves you can take to protect your innovation.… Things like a complex product, big lead times [and other] bars to imitation.
What I tried to understand in my research was that when formal intellectual property becomes less strong, or less effective, you might switch to using informal intellectual property protection. This is one of the aspects of the study.
Knowledge@Wharton: What are the main takeaways from your research? How can startups take what you have found and apply it practically to their business?
Contigiani: I basically hand collected data on the product development processes of 1,200 software startups [using] online sources such as tech magazines and social media. I [tracked the firms] to see when they were testing or experimenting and when they were essentially launching their products — actually entering the market. I wanted to see how the overall strategy of these companies changed when this court decision, Alice, took place because it essentially made patenting [formal intellectual property] much harder for some companies.
I found two things, broadly speaking. One is that after Alice took place, the affected companies changed strategies. In particular, they seem to be less likely to test their product; they do less experimentation. Given that they can no longer use patents to protect their ideas, experimentation becomes risky. Sure, you get the benefit of learning, but the cost of doing so goes up. So it’s not necessarily a good idea.
On the other hand, they seem to launch their product faster. They go to market sooner and so they can start getting feedback. Adapting your product, or pivoting, once you are in the market is a little harder [than early testing], because adaptation costs are higher. But on the other hand, once you do that you are essentially creating other barriers to imitation, like brand and network effects. So it is safer.
The second result is more about performance, and there I looked at what happened to companies that did a lot of experimentation while in the new post-Alice regime where they could not really protect through patents. I saw a negative correlation between doing that and performance.
Companies that experimented a lot without potential access to patent protection were less likely to get funding, and they also seemed less likely to get acquired. And so overall, this choice seemed to really affect the performance.
“What I tried to understand in my research was that when formal intellectual property becomes less strong, or less effective, you might switch to using informal intellectual property protection.”
The [practical] implication for startups is that in very uncertain markets … when you choose that strategy [of market experimentation] you really have to take into account how you can protect your invention…. It is really important to keep an eye on intellectual property and appropriability because it can really hurt you if you don’t. By talking to entrepreneurs, my sense is that they are really focused on learning, less so on appropriability.
There are also implications for other players in the economy, so I will briefly talk about those. I think this matters to investors. Investors seemed to be really aware of this trade-off, because I saw companies that didn’t seem to worry about appropriability get less funding. [But then perhaps they’re investing] in companies that needed a lot of learning because they are building something very new, very novel. If so, you might need a lot of experimentation, but [you also] will need to protect yourself through IP effectively.
I want to end with implications for public policy, because that may matter as well. Policy makers obviously care a lot about innovation. Now if in important markets or sub-sectors of the economy it is really hard to protect through IP, [companies in sectors where experimentation is important] might be less likely to succeed. On the other hand, companies might realize that actually it is hard to try to build innovative products without being able to safely experiment, so they might [stop experimenting] and try to actually compete in more traditional markets. That would mean less innovation for the economy.
Knowledge@Wharton: What sets your research apart from prior work in this area?
Contigiani: What I was trying to do was to really understand this idea of experimentation, and more broadly understand the lean methodology, which I think is a fundamental innovation of this past decade. There are a few other researchers around the world doing research on this. But I’d like to think that at least I tried to differentiate my work in a couple of ways.
I put together a detailed data set of how companies test, when companies launch, how companies do afterwards…. Most other studies on this use very small data sets, or mostly they look at case studies. Those approaches have very important advantages as well, but obviously it is hard to do statistical inference without large samples.
Putting together this large sample was a big effort. I really want to mention that I worked with an amazing team of research assistants, and they were partly Wharton undergrads, and partly people around the world that I hired.
“In very uncertain markets … when you choose that strategy [of market experimentation] you really have to take into account how you can protect your invention.”
I would also mention a couple of other things that are more academic, and in some sense, I think have some value for research. One is that I haven’t seen much other work trying to examine or trying to use the Alice Supreme Court decision. That was such an important event, and I think research should really look at it. In my area, I think this is the first study that does that.
Also, there are two important streams of research in management strategy: research on organization learning, research on appropriability. [Current literature] looks at two sides of this trade-off on experimentation, [but they] haven’t been combined too much. My work does try to connect them.
Knowledge@Wharton: How will you follow up this research? What’s next?
Contigiani: I definitely want to keep going and understand a little more of what are the boundary conditions of experimentation — in startups primarily, but maybe also in large firms and to some extent in governments and [public] policy. At all of those levels people innovate, and maybe we can try to see how and when experimentation makes innovation better and more effective.
There are a couple of things that I really want to work on soon. There are at least two other boundary conditions of experimentation that I think we need to think about. One is reputation. When you go to market very early with a minimum viable product — with an early stage product, with a prototype — that is super helpful because it helps you get market feedback and learn.
On the other hand, if the feedback is negative, while it’s useful because you can pivot early on, that feedback might affect your reputation.… It doesn’t seem to me that entrepreneurs and maybe even investors consider [risks to reputation] carefully. I want look at the data and see how it plays out.
“At all of those levels people innovate, and maybe we can try to see how and when experimentation makes innovation better and more effective.”
There was a really nice study from Duke University and from Harvard University a few years ago that looked at how rating systems affect the way companies behave and strategize. I think rating systems are a very nice empirical tool to measure reputation. So I want to see how experimentation plays out in some sectors where rating systems are more or less strong, or more or less organized, to try to understand the reputational concerns of experimentation.
The second piece is really looking at the learning process itself. Experimentation lets you learn but may have these other costs like imitation or reputation. But actually learning is to some extent the most fundamental piece here. Now there is a lot of research in strategy that shows that learning is hard to do. You can get information, but you are not necessarily learning the right thing.
That’s because there are many types of biases which arise both at the individual level — people learn in different ways — and at the collective level, at the team level. It depends on the structure of the team, the experience of the team, and how the team works together. We need to look at the learning process and see how we can make that work optimally to make experimentation work well.

Claiming Artificial Intelligence: AI-related Patent Filing Trends and Practice Tips | McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff LLP - JDSupra,http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/claiming-artificial-intelligence-ai-71727/,"


	The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has progressed rapidly over the last few decades, resulting in billions of people using AI of some form or another in their daily lives.[1] Such widespread adoption of the technology has prompted experts to suggest that the AI market could grow to as large as $15.7 trillion within the next two decades.[2] Accordingly, rewards clearly await innovators who can invent, build, sell, license, or otherwise leverage AI-related technologies. However, in light of Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l and other more recent developments with regard to patentable subject matter, individual inventors and companies alike may be uncertain how to secure AI-related intellectual property (IP) assets.[3]

	Here, the authors utilize various patent search and analytical tools, including Google Advanced Patent Search and Juristat, to obtain quantitative information on published AI-related patent filings. Based on such data, this article illustrates interesting trends in global patent filings, art unit assignment by claim term usage, and recent outcomes for AI-related patent applications, all of which may assist patent practitioners develop effective strategies for protecting innovations in this burgeoning technology area.

	First, research indicates, perhaps as expected, that AI-related patent application filings have been increasing throughout the world at growing annualized rates. Figure 1 illustrates the number of AI-related patent application filings in various jurisdictions between the years 2006 and 2016.[4]

Figure 1: Number of AI-related Patent Applications Filed by Year and Jurisdiction



	Notably, in 2016, AI-related patent application filings in China outpaced those of other popular jurisdictions, including the United States (U.S.), Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), Europe, Japan, and Korea. Other reports confirm this trend continuing through at least 2017.[5] The recent trend of increased funding for Chinese AI startups might explain this growth; those startups reportedly received nearly 50% of total global AI startup funds in 2017.[6]

	While China is becoming a leader in the AI patent space, the U.S. has also recently seen tremendous growth in this technology area. For example, in 2016, applicants filed 9,605 AI-related patent applications in the U.S., a decade-over-decade increase of almost 500%.[7]

	Second, research suggests that those seeking AI patent protection in the U.S. should carefully assess the particular claim language used to describe their inventions, as different AI‑related claim terms could lead to vastly different patent examination outcomes. More specifically, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) assigns each U.S. patent application to one of many art units, which are organizational units of patent examiners. Each USPTO art unit is responsible for a set of technology subclasses in the U.S. Patent Classification System (USPC). According to the USPTO, classification of “invention information” for U.S. patent documents is mandatory, and such invention information “is almost always in the claims.”[8] Therefore, the USPTO considers claim language to be a key factor when assigning an application to an art unit.

	In this regard, different art units may have different examination outcomes, such as with respect to application allowance rates, examination periods, and types of rejections issued. Consequently, applicants may find it worthwhile to evaluate the relationship between common AI-related claim terms and art unit assignments. Table 1 illustrates the most popular USPTO art unit assignments for U.S. patent applications that recite various AI-related claim terms.[9]

Table 1: Popular USPTO Art Unit Assignments By AI-related Claim Term



	As shown, for each claim term, the five most-popular art units are ordered from top to bottom according to the number of patent applications assigned thereto that include the claim term at issue. For example, patent applications including the claim term “artificial intelligence” were most likely to be assigned to art unit 2129.[10] Generally, this result is expected, as the art unit 2129 examines patent applications related to “Miscellaneous Computer Applications.”

	However, a review of Table 1 indicates that use of certain AI-related claim terms could lead to some unexpected results. For example, patent applications that include the terms “regression” or “clustering” are most commonly assigned to the art unit 1631, which examines patent applications related to “Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Nucleic Acids, Recombinant DNA and RNA, Gene Regulation, Nucleic Acid Amplification, Animals and Plants, Combinatorial/ Computational Chemistry”.[11] This result could stem from frequent use of the terms “regression” or “clustering” in the fields of biology and chemistry, or may be due to other reasons. However, in any case, those seeking AI patent protection in the U.S. should consider the results in Table 1, in an effort to avoid assignment to unintended art units.

	Furthermore, in addition to evaluating the relationship between common AI-related claim terms and art unit assignments, it is beneficial to review the historical examination outcomes for those art units. This way, those seeking AI-related patent protection in the U.S. may be able to adjust their claim term usage in an effort to obtain more favorable examination outcomes. For example, applicants could try to have their applications assigned to an art unit that has, on average, a higher historical allowance rate and/or a faster time to allowance.

	Table 2 includes relevant outcome-based statistics for the five most common art units associated with the claim terms shown in Table 1.[12]

Table 2: Patent Prosecution Outcomes for the Five Most-Common AI-related Art Units



	Table 2 indicates that art unit 2129 is not only the most common art unit associated with the AI-related claim terms in Table 1, but it is also one of the more favorable art units in terms of patent prosecution outcomes. From among the top five art units listed in Table 2, art unit 2129 has the highest allowance rate and the shortest average time from filing to allowance. Additionally, although art unit 2129 may not seem to have the lowest rejection percentages, especially in comparison to art unit 2122, the average number of office actions of 1.5 indicates that, in many cases, the prosecution phase in art unit 2129 may be relatively short.

	On the other hand, research indicates that art unit 1631 is historically the least favorable art unit among those listed in Table 2. Namely, among the top five art units, art unit 1631 has the lowest allowance rate, the highest rejection percentage average, the highest average number of office actions, and the longest average time to allowance.

	Table 2 illustrates other stark differences between art units 2129 and 1631. First, a review of the rejection statistics (i.e., % Alice Rejections, % 101 Rejections, % 102 Rejections, and % 103 Rejections) indicates that examiners in art unit 1631 issue, on average, 8% more rejections than art unit 2129 in each rejection type. Perhaps more significantly, examiners in art unit 1631 issue 22.62% more Alice rejections than those in art unit 2129 and 10.92% more 101 rejections than those in art unit 2129. The difference in Alice rejections is important to note, as Alice-type rejections are common for software patents.[13]

	Significant differences between art units 2129 and 1631 also exist with respect to the average number of office actions and time to allowance. In particular, patent applications assigned to art unit 2129 receive about 1.5 office actions on average. This indicates that art unit 2129 may issue perhaps one or two office actions, and could issue a notice of allowance without even issuing a final rejection. Contrast this with the average of 3.4 office actions issued by art unit 1631, more than twice that of art unit 2129. Such data indicate that applicants having applications assigned to art unit 1631 may end up filing at least one request for continued examination (RCE). Finally, patent applications in art unit 1631 take more than 14 months longer to be allowed than those of art unit 2129. As such, not only is it much less likely for a patent application to be allowed if assigned to art unit 1631, but the likelihood of an RCE may significantly increase the costs and length of patent prosecution.

	In conclusion, research involving publicly available patent publication records confirms that AI innovation is expanding rapidly throughout the world, particularly in China. In the United States, AI-related patent applications are being assigned to a relatively small set of examination art units, based, in large part, on claim language. The vastly different outcomes across these art units should prompt patent practitioners to think carefully – before filing – about the specific claim terms recited in their patent applications. Such considerations could result in better applicant outcomes, including higher allowance rates and faster, more cost-effective patent prosecution.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently exploded onto the scene as a technology that will redefine the next technological age. It is estimated that 38 percent of all businesses are implementing AI in one form or another, and that adoption rate is expected to grow to 62 percent in 2018. See “Artificial Intelligence Collides with Patent Law”, World Economic Forum White Paper (April 2018). Similarly, global revenue from AI-based systems is expected to grow from nearly $8 billion in 2016 to more than $47 billion in 2020. See Bloomberg Law, “2017 Outlook IP, Privacy, Tech and Telecom,” Daily Report for Executives (2016).

"Judge Taranto, Meet Judge Taranto - IPWatchdog.com",https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/08/24/judge-taranto-meet-judge-taranto/id=100449/,"
Judge Jimmie Reyna’s decision in McRO v Bandai is without question one of the best decisions to emerge from the Federal Circuit as it competently addressed key elements of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank.  Judge Kara Stoll and Judge Richard Taranto, who signed onto this landmark opinion, should also be praised with Judge Reyna.  The McRO decision, among other things, stands for the idea that software is a process under 35 U. S. C. § 101, and that a claim that does naught more than receive data, process data and “apply” the processed data is patent eligible under § 101.  The representative claim of McRO is reproduced below for convenience.
A method for automatically animating lip synchronization and facial expression of three-dimensional characters comprising:
obtaining a first set of rules that define output morph weight set stream as a function of phoneme sequence and time of said phoneme sequence;
obtaining a timed data file of phonemes having a plurality of sub-sequences;
generating an intermediate stream of output morph weight sets and a plurality of transition parameters between two adjacent morph weight sets by evaluating said plurality of sub-sequences against said first set of rules;
generating a final stream of output morph weight sets at a desired frame rate from said intermediate stream of output morph weight sets and said plurality of transition parameters; and
applying said final stream of output morph weight sets to a sequence of animated characters to produce lip synchronization and facial expression control of said animated characters.
Now contrast the above-recited claim to a representative claim in SAP America v. InvestPic opinion re-issued on August 2, 2018 – said opinion authored by Judge Taranto.
A method for calculating, analyzing and displaying investment data comprising the steps of:
(a) selecting a sample space, wherein the sample space includes at least one investment data sample;
(b) generating a distribution function using a re-sampled statistical method and a bias parameter, wherein the bias parameter determines a degree of randomness in a resampling process; and,
(c) generating a plot of the distribution function.
There is no assertion by the Federal Circuit that the InvestPic claim above is anticipated or obvious, and indeed Judge Taranto acknowledges that the InvestPic claims may represent an improvement in the field of market analysis.  “Here, the focus of the claims is . . . the improved mathematical analysis.”  Investpic, slip op. at p. 14.  However, Judge Taranto nonetheless declared that, despite any possible innovation, the Investpic claims “fit into the familiar class of claims that do not ‘focus . . . on [] an improvement in computers as tools, but on certain independently abstract ideas that use computers as tools.’”  Id.  That is, Judge Taranto dismisses the idea that a claimed improvement may be directed to a technology process not related to computer science.  Compare Alice Corp., which correctly observed, inter alia, that the mathematical computer claims “in Diehr were patent eligible because they improved an existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.” Alice Corp., slip op. at p. 13.
To justify the InvestPic decision, Judge Taranto attempts to distinguish the claims in McRO by stating the following:
“Contrary to InvestPic’s contention, the claims here are critically different from those we determined to be patent eligible in McRO . . . . The claims in McRO were directed to the creation of something physical – namely, the display of “lip synchronization and Facial expressions” of animated characters on screens for viewing by human eyes.  The claimed improvement was to how the physical display operated (to produce better quality images)” (internal citations omitted).
Contrary to Judge Taranto’s position, not only does the McRO claim not produce a physical improvement to a display (contrast In re Allapat), but as can be seen above a display is not even recited in the McRO claim.  Judge Taranto’s position is as best an assertion that a physical display somehow works better because of the content displayed is subjectively more appealing.  However, a colorized version of The Maltese Falcon does not improve the intrinsic qualities of a generic display.  Similarly, the intrinsic qualities of a Kindle reader are not improved based on the quality of an author’s style of writing.
Not only is Taranto’s assertion absurd on its face to any novice student of electrical engineering, but the McRO Appellant/Patentee never asserted any improvement to a display as is evidenced by the Appellant’s briefs and statements during oral argument.
Indeed, it was the Appellant’s position in McRO that the patents at issue “address an improvement to a specific technological process.” Doc 69, p. 37.  “They recite a technological method that enables a computer to do something it could not do before.”  Id.  “Clip 3, illustrates precisely how the method ‘improve[s] an existing technological process.’”  Doc 69, p. 53.
Further, the Appellant’s positions are well-represented within the four-corners of the McRO decision, which makes no mention of an improved display.  “It is the incorporation of the claimed rules, not the use of the computer, that “improved [the] existing technological process” (emphasis added). McRO, slip op. at. p. 24.  “The claim uses the limited rules in a process specifically designed to achieve an improved technological result” (emphasis added). Id. at. p. 27.
A software process was improved in McRO, and Judge Taranto’s attempt to assert that the operation of a physical display is improved is facially absurd.
Also completely missing from Judge Taranto’s opinion is any discussion of how the InvestPic claims differ from the software claims in Aatrix v. Green Shades, and Berkheimer v. HP – other landmark opinions that Judge Taranto signed onto.
Judge Taranto might have filed a dissent in Berkheimer.  Judge Taranto might have filed a dissent in Aatrix as did Judge Reyna to completely change the outcome.  However, for reasons not explained to the gentry, Judge Taranto declined such efforts.
Perhaps there is a coherent argument under the Alice/Mayo framework to credibly distinguish InvestPic from McRO, Berkheimer and Aatrix.  However, the patent community will likely be waiting a long time to hear it.

Ignorance Is Not Bliss: Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International* - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/07/25/ignorance-is-not-bliss-alice-corp-v-cls-bank-international/id=50517/,"
Justice ThomasI feel like a very broken record. In an IPWatchdog article I wrote back in 2012, I commented on the currently fractured patent-eligibility landscape in the split Federal Circuit panel decision in CLS Bank International v. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. where a claimed trading platform for exchanging business obligations survived a validity challenge under 35 U.S.C. § 101. See The Fractured Landscape of Patent Eligibility for Business Methods and Systems in CLS Bank International. That fracture got even worse in the subsequent en banc ruling which can only be described as lengthy, tumultuous, and confusing, with a brief per curiam opinion, as well as six full opinions.
With the Supreme Court’s most recent foray into the patent-eligibility world in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, we now have a complete and utter disaster as to what data processing claims can (or more unfortunately cannot) survive scrutiny by Our Judicial Mount Olympus under 35 U.S.C. § 101. I once had respect for Justice Thomas’ view on patent law jurisprudence, having considered his substandard opinion in Myriad on the patent-eligibility of certain “isolated” DNA claims to be an “isolated” aberration. But having now read his mind-boggling Opinion for the Court in Alice Corp., I’ve now thrown my previously “cheery” view of Thomas’ understanding of patent law jurisprudence completely into the toilet. I have even less kind words to say about the three Justices that signed onto Justice Sotomayor’s disingenuous concurring opinion that accepts retired Justice Steven’s equally disingenuous suggestion in Bilski that 35 U.S.C. § 273 (in which Congress acknowledged implicitly, if not explicitly the patent-eligibility of “business methods” under 35 U.S.C. § 101) is a mere “red herring.” See Section 273 is NOT a Red Herring: Steven’s Disingenuous Concurrence in Bilski.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Alice Corp. operates from the view that “ignorance is bliss” when it come to the patent statutes, as well science and technology. I don’t share that view and never will. So in the format that I began with in shredding Justice Alito’s “comedic” opinion in Limelight Networks, here are my “ignorance is not bliss” candidates for Alice Corp., in all their ugliness.

Ignorance Is Not Bliss Point No. 1
Comingling the Separate Patent Statutes on Patent-Eligibility and Patentability.
Justice Thomas’ Opinion for the Court relies upon (unfortunately) the “framework” of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. for separating patent-ineligible “claims to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts.” Thomas describes this “framework” as a two-part analysis: (1) “determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts”; and (2) “search for the ‘inventive concept’ —i.e., “an element or combination of elements that is “sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.” But this second part of the analysis (i.e., search for the “inventive concept”) essentially commingles patent-eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101 with patentability that includes novelty under 35 U.S.C. § 102, as well as obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103. In other words, the feared comingling of patent-eligibility with patentability when Justice Breyer announced the term “inventive concept” in Mayo in judging claimed methods under 35 U.S.C. § 101 is now (regrettably) fully bloomed.
Ignorance Is Not Bliss Point No. 2
No Adherence to the Fundamental Principle of Diehr that the Claimed Invention Must Be “Considered as a Whole.”
In footnote 3 of the Opinion of the Court, Thomas makes the following statement: “Because the approach we made explicit in Mayo considers all claim elements, both individually and in combination, it is consistent with the general rule that patent claims “must be considered as a whole,” (citing to Diamond v. Diehr). That statement is astonishing because it is utterly nonsensical. By separating out the alleged “abstract idea” in the first step of the analytical “framework,” Thomas, in Alice Corp. continues the disingenuous failure of Mayo to adhere to this fundamental principle of Diehr that “[i]t is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis.” So much for following binding SCOTUS precedent by Our Judicial Mount Olympus.
Ignorance Is Not Bliss Point No. 3
Still No Definition Yet of What Is/Is Not an “Abstract Idea.”
Near the end of part A of the Opinion of the Court, Thomas makes the following statement: “we need not labor to delimit the precise contours of the ‘abstract ideas’ category in this case. Put differently, what Thomas essentially does in Alice Corp. (as Justice Kennedy did before in Bilski) is “punt” on providing any meaningful definition of what is (and more importantly is not) an “abstract idea.” So much for providing us “mere mortals” with any “framework” of how to distinguish “abstract” from “non-abstract” ideas other than “we know it when we see it, but we in the Ivory Tower are not going to tell you mere mortals’ what our ‘secret’ is for so determining.”
Ignorance Is Not Bliss Point No. 4
Claims Will Be Deemed Patent-Ineligible Even Though Implemented by a “Machine,” i.e., a Computer.
At page 11 of the Opinion of the Court, Thomas states that “[t]he introduction of a computer into claims does not alter the analysis of Mayo step two.” While such “introduction” may not “alter the analysis of Mayo step two,” that so called “analysis” is fundamentally flawed in that a computer is nonetheless a machine, and machines are definitely within the statutory classes of subject matter denoted in 35 U.S.C. § 101. While the process steps implemented on such computers may be known (i.e., may lack novelty under 35 U.S.C. § 102 or may be obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103), that process implemented on the computer is nonetheless a machine implemented process when considered “as a whole” as mandated by Diehr. That Gottschalk v. Benson and Parker v. Flook (cited by Thomas to support this quoted statement) say otherwise simply ignores the fundamental fact that computers ARE patent-eligible machines. Accordingly, processes implemented on such computers do not change those computers (so altered) into patent-ineligible machines.
Ignorance Is Not Bliss Point No. 5
Concurring Opinion Says Congress’ Implicit/Express Intent on What Is Patent-Eligible May Be Ignored.
The most startling statement in Alice Corp. occurs in Justice Sotomayor’s concurring opinion (joined by Justice Ginsburg and Breyer): “I adhere to the view that any ‘claim that merely describes a method of doing business does not qualify as a ‘process’ under §101,’” citing retired Justice Steven’s concurring opinion in Bilski. In other words, these three Justices have bought “hook, line, and sinker” Steven’s disingenuous view that Congress’ at least implicit, if not explicit acknowledgement in 35 U.S.C. § 273 that “business methods” are patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 “is a red herring.” So much for these three Justices giving anymore than “lip service” to the expressed will and intent of Congress.
Our Judicial Mount Olympus may subscribe in Alice Corp. to the popular belief that “ignorance” of science, computer technology (as well as the patent statutes) “is bliss.” But such “ignorance” is mucking up our patent law jurisprudence, as well as “not so blissfully” impeding the creative spirit of our innovative Davids, our real hope for job growth in America. And that’s no “red herring,” Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Breyer!

"No Light at the End of the Tunnel, Not Even Close",https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/08/01/no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/id=99473/,"
Last February, in light of the recent Berkheimer and Aatrix cases, Attorney Meredith Addy wrote an excellent article for IP Watchdog entitled: “Is there a Light at the End of the Alice Tunnel?”  In her article, Meredith Addy aspired “[h]opefully . . . this is the beginning of a recognition of the underlying facts and the procedure required for proper Rule 12 dismissal, and not just a blip in the Alice carnage.”  Five months later, it is clear that Ms. Addy was too optimistic.
It’s been over eight years since the Supreme Court issued its Bilski v Kappos decision, over six years since the Supreme Court issued its Mayo v. Prometheus decision and over four years since the Supreme Court issued its Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank decision.  In case anyone missed it, each of these three landmark cases was decided based on evidence on the record.  See, e.g., Mayo, slip op. at p. 10 (using admissions made in the patent specification as evidence); Alice Corp., slip op. at p. 9 (citing various textbooks as evidence for the underlying business methods of both Bilski and Alice Corp.).  Thus, the Supreme Court not only contemplated the need for evidence when determining patent eligibility for abstract ideas of man-made origin, but wholly embraced the practice.
Yet despite the Supreme Court’s trio of evidence-based holdings, it was February of this year before a single three-judge Federal Circuit panel definitively ruled on the evidence issue in Berkheimer v. HP, and it was the end of May before a majority of the Federal Circuit signed on to the idea that determining whether a man-made something is well-understood (or well-known), routine and conventional is an issue of fact that should be based on objective evidence.  That’s the better part of a decade of the Federal Circuit wandering the desert despite having a sextant, a sky full of bright stars and a truckload of the most modern GPS systems known to man.  This isn’t comforting.

Further, the honorable Judge Reyna’s dissent in Berkheimer en banc (as with Aatrix) is puzzling given Judge Reyna’s holding in McRo v. Bandai.  That is, despite Judge Reyna’s recent anti-evidence stance, a reading of McRO (penned by Judge Reyna) reveals he decided that the McRO claims were patent-eligible based on a lack of evidence.  “Defendants provided no evidence that the process previously used by animators is the same as the process required by the claims” (emphasis added).  McRO, slip op. at p. 24.  “Defendants’ attorney’s argument that any rules-based lip-synchronization process must use the claimed type of rules has appeal, but no record evidence supports this conclusion” (emphasis added).  McRO, slip op. at p. 26.  Clarification is needed.
In contrast to Judge Reyna, the honorable Judge Taranto signed on to all three of the pro-evidence McRO, Aatrix and Berkheimer en banc decisions.  However, despite Judge Taranto’s recent epiphany on the need for evidence, his Electric Power Group v. Alstom and SAP America v. Investpic decisions are devoid of any discussion of evidence on the record.  Alstom and Investpic are arguably the two worst anti-evidence patent-eligibility decisions to date.  These cases cannot be reasonably reconciled with McRO, Aatrix and Berkheimer, and few information-age claims survive the holdings of these cases.
Note that I am not declaring that the claims of either of Alstom or Investpic must be patent eligible.  I merely assert that Judge Taranto’s holdings in these cases cannot be reconciled with the holdings of McRO, Aatrix and Berkheimer, all of which Judge Taranto signed on to.  I also posit that the Alstom and Investpic decisions cannot be reconciled with the holdings of at least DDR Holdings, Trading Technologies, Enfish and Finjan.
For example, in Alstom, the Federal Circuit declared that merely “presenting the results of abstract processes of collecting and analyzing information, without more (such as identifying a particular tool for presentation)” cannot be patent eligible.  Alstom, slip op. at p. 7.  Note that Alstom doesn’t identify what might qualify as a “particular tool for presentation,” or why a “particular tool for presentation” is necessary under Alice/Mayo.  The court’s supporting citations of Content Extraction and Ultramercial provide no apparent clue.  Further, Bilski clearly states that “courts ‘should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature has not expressed.’”  Bilski, slip op. at p. 2 (citing Diamond v. Diehr), and it is worth noting that DDR Holdings, Trading Technologies, McRO, Enfish, Finjan, Berkheimer and Aatrix involve claims that do nothing more that collect, process and (maybe) display data.
The Alstom decision is problematic.  However, compared to Alstom, the recent Investpic holding is far more disturbing.  Not only did the Federal Circuit eschew the need for an evidence-based analysis, but the court declared that no advantage under step two of the two-part Alice/Mayo test could cure abstractness.  “The claims here are ineligible because their innovation is an innovation in ineligible subject matter.”  Investpic, slip op. at p. 3.  “In the absence of the required ‘inventive concept’ in application, the claims here are legally equivalent to claims simply to the asserted advance in the realm of abstract ideas – an advance in mathematical techniques in finance.”  Investpic, slip op. at p. 13.  “Under the principles developed in interpreting § 101, patent law does not protect such claims, without more, no matter how groundbreaking the advance.”  Id.
The rule established by the Investpic decision represents a frightening and legally-impermissible departure from the Alice/Mayo test as it de jure and de facto writes out the second step for an entire genre of information age inventions.  There is nothing in Bilski or Alice Corp. that justifies the Investpic holding.  In fact, the holdings of both Bilski and Alice Corp. are narrow.  Specifically, Bilski or Alice Corp. stand for the idea that one cannot patent a long-known business method by merely evoking a computer.  In contrast, new and never before seen business methods fall outside the scope of the Bilski and Alice Corp. holdings, and the Investpic claims represent a new business method even if the results cannot be physically touched.  “The concern underlying the exceptions to § 101 is not tangibility, but preemption.”  McRO, slip op. at p. 25 (citing Mayo).
In an attempt to distinguish Investpic from McRO, Judge Taranto stated the following:
“[T]he claims here are critically different from those we determined to be patent eligible in McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games America Inc.  The claims in McRO were directed to the creation of something physical – namely, the display of “lip synchronization and facial expressions” of animated characters on screens for viewing by human eyes.  The claimed improvement was to how the physical display operated (to produce better quality images), unlike (what is present here) a claimed improvement in a mathematical technique with no improved display mechanism. The claims in McRO thus were not abstract in the sense that is dispositive here. And those claims also avoided being “abstract” in another sense reflected repeatedly in our cases (based on a contrast not with “physical” but with “concrete”): they had the specificity required to transform a claim from one claiming only a result to one claiming a way of achieving it” (internal citations omitted).
A few issues arise
First, without question the Investpic claims have sufficient specificity “to transform a claim from one claiming only a result to one claiming a way of achieving it.”  In fact, the holding of Investpic gives no indication as to what “specificity” is lacking from the Investpic claims that precludes a person of ordinary skill from achieving the claimed methods and systems.
As a second issue, the first definition that pops up for a Google-based search of “concrete” is: “existing in a material or physical form.”  If there’s a distinction between the concepts of “physical” and “concrete,” it is not made clear in the body of the Investpic decision.
As a third issue, there is nothing more “physical” about McRO’s set of resultant vectors used to create an image on a screen than Investpic’s market/investment analyses.  In fact, I posit that financial markets are real; Wall Street is real; 3D cartoons are not.  However, despite Judge Taranto’s belief in McRO’s physical nature, “[t]he concern underlying the exceptions to § 101 is not tangibility, but preemption.”  McRO, slip op. at p. 25.
As a fourth issue, Investpic panel appears to be mistaking I-don’t-know-what for the concept of abstractness.  There is no assertion of the Investpic claims amounting to something well-understood, routine and conventional, or somehow being part of the prior art.  There is no apparent discussion of why the Investpic claims are overly broad or even if they are overly broad.  There is no assertion that the Investpic claims would pose an undue risk of preemption of anything.  It is worth repeating: “[t]he concern underlying the exceptions to § 101 is . . . preemption.”
It is not my intention to criticize the judges on the Alstom and Investpic panels.  However, one simply cannot seriously discuss the Alstom and Investpic cases without discussing the erroneous judicial theories championed by the judges involved in those cases.  I greatly respect the Federal Circuit’s decisions as a whole, and find the Federal Circuit’s decisions outside the realm of patent-eligibility always to be insightful and informative.  That said, one can cite conflicting and irreconcilable holdings from most judges on the Federal Circuit on the patent eligibility issue.  It is my position that much of the inconsistency – not just judge to judge, but by the same judges case to case – stems from seemingly contradicting holdings and nebulous dicta from various Supreme Court decisions that the Federal Circuit failed to correctly resolve.
However, the remainder of the § 101 problem is wholly owned by Federal Circuit.  Far too many decisions have issued that are not based on record evidence and/or the idea of preemption.  The precedent set by these cases will warp patent eligibility analyses for decades to come unless the Federal Circuit produces an en banc decision and walks back many of its erroneous decisions.  While there is the possibility that the Supreme Court may wake up and seriously consider one of the constant stream of relevant certiorari petitions sent to them, I’m not holding my breath.
I assert that there are at least four problems caused by the Federal Circuit that led to the ongoing judicial “carnage,” which will be addressed in a following article.  I also assert that nothing will get better until all four of these problems are corrected. Stay tuned.

Patent Docs: Supreme Court Issues Decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank,http://www.patentdocs.org/2014/06/supreme-court-issues-decision-in-alice-corp-v-cls-bank.html,"
Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (2014)
By Kevin E. Noonan --
This morning, in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, the Supreme affirmed the Federal Circuit's per curiam opinion in CLS Bank v. Alice Corp. in a unanimous opinion by Justice Thomas with a concurring opinion by Justice Sotomayor joined by Justices Breyer and Ginsberg.  The decision appears to be an incremental one, insofar as it does not strike down all software patents and is crafted as an application of the Court's earlier precedent, particularly Bilski v. Kappos and Mayo Collaborative Serv. v. Prometheus Labs.
The decision affirms patent ineligibility for the method claims (directed, according to the Court, to methods for implementing an intermediated settlement that are well-known in the art), system claims involving implementation of the method using a general purpose computer and computer code for directing a general purpose computer to implement the method.  From the opinion, it is clear that the Court is still striving for balance between tying up fundamental building blocks that would inhibit innovation while not swallowing patent law whole because everything ultimately is based on an abstract idea, law of nature or natural phenomenon:
We have ""repeatedly emphasized this . . . concern that patent law not inhibit further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of "" these  building  blocks of human ingenuity"" [quoting O'Reilly v. Morse as cited in Mayo].  ""At the same time, we tread carefully in construing this exclusionary principle lest it swallow all of patent law"" because ""[a]t some level, ""all inventions . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of  nature, natural phenomena, or  abstract ideas"" [citing Mayo].
Accordingly, in applying the §101 exception, we must distinguish between patents that claim the ""'buildin[g] block[s]'"" of human ingenuity and those that integrate the building blocks into something more, thereby ""transform[ing]"" them into a patent-eligible invention.  The former ""would risk disproportionately tying up the use of the underlying"" ideas and are therefore ineligible for patent protection.  The latter pose no comparable risk of pre-emption, and therefore remain eligible for the monopoly granted under our patent laws"" [citing liberally from the Mayo opinion].
The Court considers the Mayo opinion to have provided the framework for performing the patent-eligibility analysis:
First, we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts.  If so, we then ask, ""[w]hat else is there in the claims before us?""  To answer that question, we consider the elements of each claim both individually and ""as an ordered combination"" to determine whether the additional elements ""transform the nature of the claim"" into a patent-eligible application.  We have described step two of this analysis as a search for an "" 'inventive concept'"" -- i.e., an element or combination of elements that is ""sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.""
The Court also considers its jurisprudence from Gottschalk v. Benson, through Parker v. Flook, Bilski and to Mayo to be consistent in both the underlying principles and how the analysis should be done.  The opinion distinguishes its seemingly contrary decision in Diamond v. Diehr in a way that may be useful in making decisions regarding what is patent-eligible subject matter (and how it should be claimed):  ""In other words, the claims in Diehr were patent eligible because they improved an existing technological process, not be­cause they were implemented on a computer"" (emphasis added).  And, in a footnote, the Court declares that its Mayo analysis is consistent with the patent law principle that the claims should be considered as a whole because the Mayo decision instructs a court to consider the elements of the claim at issue both individually and as a whole.
The Court's opinion expressly ties its decision here to the decision in Bilski, based on the perceived similarity between attempts in each case to preempt a preexisting human activity (hedging in Bislki, intermediated settlement here) as being abstract ideas (and once again conflating Section 101 with Sections 102 and 103), the Court stating that ""[i]t is enough to recognize that there is no meaningful distinc­tion between the concept of risk hedging in Bilski and the concept of intermediated settlement at issue here.  Both are squarely within the realm of 'abstract ideas' as we have used that term.""  And after a brief discussion of the Court's understanding of how a conventional general purpose computer works, the Court opines that how the computer implements the claimed (and ineligible) method is not ""enough"" to render the system claims patent eligible because said implementation is entirely conventional.
The Court's opinion also provides guidance on how it will determine what is ""enough"" that must be added to an abstract idea, law of nature or natural phenomenon to render a claim encompassing these categories to be patent-eligible, based on the rubric that there must be something in the claimed invention that improves existing technology:
The method claims do not, for example, purport to improve the functioning of the computer itself.  (""There is no specific or limiting recitation of . . . improved computer technology . . . ""); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–30.  Nor do they effect an improvement in any other technology or technical field.  Instead, the claims at issue amount to ""nothing significantly more"" than an instruction to apply the ab­stract idea of intermediated settlement using some un­specified, generic computer.  Under our precedents, that is not ""enough"" to transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention [citations omitted].
The system and computer-readable medium claims stand and fall with the method claims:
Put another way, the system claims are no different from the method claims in substance.  The method claims recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to implement the same idea.  This Court has long ""warn[ed] . . . against"" interpreting §101 in ways that make patent eligibility 'depend simply on the draftsman's art.'""
The Court's decision is entirely consistent with its disinclination to enunciate broad proscriptions against patenting particular areas of technology, as evidenced by its decisions in Bilski (which did not rule all business method claims to be patent-ineligible), Association for Molecular Pathologists v. Myriad Genetics (which was limited to rendering genomic DNA patent-ineligible but did not disturb patent-eligibility for cDNA, and contained express proscriptions against reading the decision to encompass methods or other applications of the knowledge of the BRCA genes, despite the PTO's recent Guidelines that appear to ignore these proscriptions) and even Bowman v. Monsanto, which cautioned against interpreting the Court's decision in that case to apply to all ""self-replicating technologies.""
Justice Sotomayor's concurring opinion is brief and to the effect that the Justice believes business method patents to be patent ineligible per se because they do not fall within the ambit of a ""process"" under the Patent Act.  Justices Breyer and Ginsberg join her here, as they did in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in Bilski.  The other Justices apparently are not yet ready to make all business method claims ineligible for patenting, provided that they satisfy the rule reiterated here that there must be something that improves existing technology or otherwise does not merely adapt methods for controlling human activity for implementation by a computer.

Surviving Alice: Counseling the Client - IPWatchdog.com,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/05/10/surviving-alice-counseling-client/id=96649/,"
This is the first of a 5-part series of practical guidance on how to avoid or overcome statutory subject matter rejections under Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2355 (2014).  The focus will be on business methods, but the guidance should be applicable to all technology fields.  This first article discusses how to effectively counsel a client in the early stages of patent preparation so that the client will provide adequate technical content in their invention disclosure.  With adequate technical content, the patent practitioner can, as discussed in the second article, craft a patent application that is much more likely to be classified in an Alice-friendly art unit (e.g. technical), as opposed to an Alice-unfriendly art unit (e.g. business method).  The remaining three articles further discuss actions that can be taken during prosecution or appeal to further increase the chances of allowance.
 
With every passing Section 101 case, the Federal Circuit continues to refine the standard for patent eligibility for computer-implemented inventions.  As it does so, patent law pundits write articles that extract Federal Circuit clues for drafting patent applications to comply with Section 101.  Even though judicial exceptions to patent-eligible subject matter have been around for a long time, the disparity among different technology classes has become pronounced.  In fact, some computer related art units at the USPTO, such as those associated with business method technology, issue Alice-based rejections at a much higher rate than other art units.  Rather than spend a significant amount of time and money on patent prosecution in such difficult art units, we describe another way to avoid the Alice battle altogether: include substantive technical content in your patent application so that, for purposes of examination, it is steered to an optimal, more Alice-friendly, art unit.
Including the right technical content in a patent application for an optimal art unit begins with the first contact between a patent practitioner and a client.  Initially, the client will communicate, either orally or in writing, a disclosure of his or her invention.  Assuming the disclosure is directed toward a business-related computer-implemented invention, the practitioner should, in view of case law, identify the following “adequate technical content”:

technical aspects of the invention,
the technical problem solved by the invention,
any technical improvements and/or perceived innovation, and/or
the critical computer functionality provided by the invention.

If the invention disclosure has adequate technical content, then the practitioner is well positioned to begin drafting the patent application.  The technical content will be the foundation of the application, while the business content will be presented as an exemplary application of the technology as a whole.  Ideally, the inventor will also describe other non-business applications.  If a client, for example, develops an improved rules-based fuzzy logic process that enables an improved accounting process, the client should be encouraged to think of other more physical, technically based applications of the improved rules-based fuzzy logic process.  The more physical applications are then described in the patent application as alternative embodiments.
Not all invention disclosures of business-related inventions, however, have adequate technical content.  This is especially true when the primary inventor is not a technologist.  In such cases, the practitioner can educate the client about the de facto technical requirements.  Be blunt: without adequate technical content, there is no realistic chance of allowance.  Straight talk about the reality of Alice will eventually be appreciated to even the most skeptical of clients.
Often times, inventions include, or at least suggest, technical aspects that are not immediately apparent from the face of the disclosure.  There are concrete ways that the practitioner can bring out these seemingly latent technical aspects.  For example, the savvy practitioner can encourage the client to articulate how the invention improves computer capability.  This can help bolster the technical aspects of the invention and avoid the invention being characterized as being directed toward an abstract idea.  See e.g., Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1335-36 (citing Alice) (Fed. Cir. 2016); Cf, TLI Communications LLC Patent Litigation, 823 F.3d 607 (Fed. Cir. 2016).
Next, the practitioner should make the client aware of the importance of corresponding the technical improvements with points (b) – (d) above and should seek to include such information in the application.  Take, for instance, point (b), the technical problem solved by the invention. This is important because inventions including a technical solution to a technical problem are more likely to be viewed as including an “inventive concept.”  See e.g., DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245, 1259, (Fed. Cir. 2014).
One way to ensure adequate technical content is to become very familiar with the details of the invention.  If possible, it is helpful to request a disclosure resembling a reduction to practice, such as a technical specification or prototype.  Development of the technical specification or prototype may require the assistance of a third-party developer.  When using a third-party developer, however, the practitioner should advise the client of the necessity of executing formal assignment documents first.  If the developer provides the technical solution to the technical problem, then the developer may become a co-inventor, depending on the extent to which the developer contributes to the claimed invention.
The following hypothetical example elaborates on an invention with a non-technical use that fails to identify all of the above-mentioned items (a) – (d):
A client discloses a rules-based application (implemented in software) having particular use in the area of accounting.  Among other things, the application includes a spreadsheet for inputting data in a selected manner.  Responsive to the selected data input, the application allows for the projection of all sorts of phenomenal and unexpected accounting results.  The disclosure only states that “fuzzy logic is used to drive the rules-based application.”  No more technical detail is given.
In accordance with the above discussion, particularly point (a), the client should be apprised of the necessity of fully fleshing out the inventive aspects of the technical implementation (i.e. the fuzzy logic).  The client, however, may not know what the technical implementation is or what technical problems may need to be overcome.  At this point, there may be no harm in filing a provisional patent application to capture the earliest priority date for the client.
The next step under point (b) is to work with the client to develop a plan for implementation.  Actual technical implementation can be expensive, but it is a very effective way to reveal technical problems that have to be solved.  Technical implementation always (in our humble experience) reveals unforeseen technical problems.  Readily available solutions may not exist.  At some point, what is readily available may need to be modified or customized to serve the specific needs of the new business application, particularly as that application is scaled up.  This is where patentable innovation occurs.  These customized solutions become the technical solutions to technical problems that are ultimately the foundation of the patent application.
Next in point (c), take a close look at the technical improvements and/or perceived innovation.  In this case, had previous accounting systems not incorporated fuzzy logic for a specific reason?  Did specific technological obstacles in a particular field make this technical implementation unrealistic or very difficult?  Answers to these questions can provide technical content to include.
Here, the client may be concerned that disclosure of a particular solution to a particular problem may reveal information the client would prefer to keep confidential.  This is an excellent opening for the practitioner to have a candid conversation with the client about the fundamental quid pro quo of the patent system.  The government provides monopoly rights to inventors specifically to encourage disclosure of inventions that inventors would otherwise wish to keep secret.  If a client is reluctant to disclose a technical solution to a technical problem, that’s a good clue that the technical solution is indeed patentable.  If the client does not trust the patent system to protect the disclosure, then that will open a door for a productive conversation about the virtues of trade secret protection.  A conscientious practitioner should be focused on assisting the client in selecting the most appropriate form of intellectual property protection consistent with the client’s needs.  There are times, particularly in this environment of 101 uncertainty, when maintaining a trade secret is a more effective option than seeking patent protection.  And, under the American Invents Act (AIA), maintaining an invention as a trade secret does not necessarily preclude seeking patent protection at a future time.
Next, in (d), the practitioner can help to identify critical computer functionality.  Often times, an invention that relies on an implementation that is rooted in computer technology is a countermeasure against an abstract idea assertion.  This is often times true if the claimed invention cannot possibly be implemented by mental processes or by pen and paper alone.
The client may be concerned about unduly limiting the coverage of the patent to a particular technical implementation.  At this point, the practitioner may want to encourage the client to simply write down all of the conceivable alternative ways the technical problem can be solved.  These alternative ways are incorporated into the patent application and reflected in the breadth of the independent claim.  If the client is still concerned about another party coming up with an unforeseen way to get around the technical problem, then another candid conversation about an essential purpose of the patent system may be in order.  The government provides patent rights to inventors because it wants to encourage others to find new solutions to technical problems.  The original inventor only gets patent rights to what the original inventor invented, not to what others might invent in the future.  It was the apparent failure of the patent system to achieve this objective by issuing patents on overly broad abstract ideas that ultimately led to the Alice decision in the first place.
In conclusion, adequate technical disclosure is essential to drafting a patent application that is likely to be classified into an Alice-friendly technical art unit.  Make sure to carefully work with the client to gather all the necessary technical information.
TO BE CONTINUED… In our next article, we will provide practical guidance on how to structure and draft a patent application so that it has a high likelihood of being classified exactly in the art unit the client intended.

Supreme Court rules in Alice Corp v. CLS Bank: abstract ideas un-patentable | Fortune,http://fortune.com/2014/06/19/supreme-court-limits-the-scope-of-software-patents/,"

The Supreme Court has deemed that abstract ideas without a novel application are not patent-eligible, limiting the scope of software patents.
The U.S.’s highest court ruled Thursday in the case of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International that an abstract idea applied to a generic computer is not “enough” to transform that idea into a patent-eligible invention.
The decision still leaves room for most software patents, though the court doesn’t elaborate beyond outlining what constitutes an abstract idea and saying that such a concept is not able to be patented generally for use on a computer.
“To be patentable, the claims will need to improve the function of the computer itself,” said Cindy Kernick, an intellectual property partner at Reed Smith. “Or make some other improvement in a technical field.”


Clarity on patents for non-abstract ideas, i.e. proprietary computer software, was not broached, leaving room for future decisions on computer-related programs that back the businesses of many current technology companies, including Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR).
(Fortune’s Roger Parloff explained the complexity of the case and why it matters to the tech community, which provides clear context around the complicated nature of this decision.)
The invention that Alice Corp. patented was a computer-implemented method of lowering risk in foreign currency trades, essentially making sure that someone won’t default after half the trade is completed. The patent, which was approved in 1999, outlined a process for incorporating a third-party intermediary, an old concept, and then described how a general computer could operate the full transaction between the three parties.

“Alice has never built a computer system capable of settling transactions according to the claimed method, has never written instructions to program any computer to perform the method,” attorneys for CLS Bank International wrote. “And has never practiced any of the asserted claims.”
Parloff points out that CLS stops short of calling Alice a patent troll outright, but labels the company a non-practicing, “patent-assertion entity.”
The Supreme Court, taking into account the above claims, said it must distinguish between the “‘building blocks’ of human ingenuity” which are not patent-eligible from “those that integrate the building blocks into something more.” In the case of Alice Corp., the high court sided with CLS: Alice fails to transform its abstract idea of intermediated settlement into a patent-worthy invention.
“The expected result is that many patents suits now pending will be resolved on summary disposition under section 101,” said Kernick. “And, hopefully this will make some of the trolls stop and rethink the merits of their demands.”

Sole Exceptions to Subject Matter Eligibility | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2018/06/exceptions-subject-eligibility.html,"
Patent owners and innovators continue to push for statutory reform of the doctrine of subject matter eligibility — with the primary goal of repudiating recent Supreme Court precedent of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012) and Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014).
Several bar associations and groups presented their proposed revisions. That approach, however, was something of a stumbling block for the initiatives. Although there was generalized unity, there has not been unity on the specifics. That is slowly changing with AIPLA, IPO, and NYIPLA all on-board with roughly the same proposal:
35 U.S.C. § 101—Inventions Patentable
(a) Eligible Subject Matter.—Whoever invents or discovers any useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any useful improvement thereof, shall be entitled to a patent therefor, subject only to the conditions and requirements set forth in this title.
(b) Sole Exceptions to Subject Matter Eligibility.—A claimed invention is ineligible under subsection (a) only if the claimed invention as a whole exists in nature independent of and prior to any human activity, or can be performed solely in the human mind.
(c) Sole Eligibility Standard.—The eligibility of a claimed invention under subsections (a) and (b) shall be determined without regard to the requirements or conditions of sections 102, 103, and 112 of this title, the manner in which the claimed invention was made or discovered, or whether the claimed invention includes an inventive concept.
Here, the term “claimed invention” does not mean what might suggest — an invention that has been claimed in a patent or patent application. Rather, the term “claimed invention” is narrowly defined as “the subject matter defined by a claim in a patent or an application for a patent.” 35 U.S.C. 100(j).  In other words, the “claimed invention” is what is claimed to be the invention.
Of course, the next step will be much more difficult for proponents of the legislation – getting Congress to act.

"Who Is Alice, And Why Is She Driving Patent Attorneys Mad As Hatters? | Above the Law",https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/who-is-alice-and-why-is-she-driving-patent-attorneys-mad-as-hatters/,"

Ed. note: This is a sponsored post from our friends at Juristat, whose statistical modeling capabilities allow users to visually plot their chance of success in every aspect of the patent application process.
Come with me down the rabbit hole, won’t you?
Every so often, the Supreme Court hands down a case that causes a seismic shift in our legal system. Constitutional law professors wax poetic about Marbury v. Madison and McCulloch v. Maryland. News analysts loudly denounce Citizens United: “Corporations aren’t people!” But ask a patent attorney for an example of such a case and you are likely to witness a ten-minute diatribe on the shortcomings of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l (2014). 

Some Basics
Before we get to Alice, however, it’s important to cover a few basics of patent law. Under section 101 of Title 35, one may receive patent protection for any process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. Precedent provides three exceptions to these generally accepted subject matter: laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. It’s this last exception that is causing so much grief.
Background
This all started back in 2010 with a case called Bilski v. Kappos. In that case, the Supreme Court confirmed that software patents are eligible for patent protection. In doing so, it utilized the machine-or-transformation test. Under that test, a claimed process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing. Although the Court utilized the test, it held that it is not the sole test for determining eligibility.
After the equally important Supreme Court holdings in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (2012) and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (2013), the USPTO issued guidance directing all patent examiners to determine whether: (1) a claim falls under the “law of nature” or “physical phenomena” exceptions, and (2) the claim as a whole recites something significantly different than the judicial exception(s). The Court did not extend this analysis to abstract ideas.
Enter Alice, a case that involved a computerized scheme for mitigating settlement risk (aka software). The Supreme Court held that claims directed to abstract ideas must have additional elements capable of rendering them significantly more than the abstract ideas themselves. According to the Court, the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. In doing so, the Court essentially extended the Myriad and Mayo framework to abstract ideas. Within days, the USPTO issued examination instructions reflecting the decision.
The Aftermath
Now that we have those riveting details out of the way, you might be wondering, “why should I care?” The answer is simple: it’s the reason your colleagues in IP keep bursting in to tears.  Take a look at the chart below to see what I mean:

This line represents the percentage of all patent rejections based on section 101. In May 2014, that percentage was only 7%. By August 2014, it nearly doubled to 12%. As of August 2015, section 101 rejections made up 15% of all rejections issued at the USPTO. That’s a massive increase, especially considering that software patents represent only a small portion of applications handled at the USPTO.
But it gets worse! Seeing as Alice dealt specifically with what patent attorneys call “business methods,” we should look to the parts of the USPTO that handle such applications.

 
Prior to Alice, section 101 made up about 31% of all rejections in this area. After Alice, that percentage increased to nearly 82%. Let that sink in. The percentage of section 101 rejections increased by 51 percentage points since June 2014! Obviously, patent attorneys aren’t happy. Not only does this make their jobs harder, it makes for unhappy clients.
What Now?
The USPTO is attempting to clarify matters by releasing further examination instructions. Nonetheless, section 101 rejections are still very much on the rise. It’s easier for patent examiners to reject applications than to try and decipher what counts as significantly more.
There is hope, however. Thanks to an odd application of Alice by the Central District of California, McRO, Inc. v. Activision Publishing, Inc. is currently before the Federal Circuit. Many assume this case will clarify Alice. I’m not so sure. Here’s to hoping we wake up and realize it was all a dream.

Software Patent Eligibility: Alice Corp v. CLS Bank on the Briefs | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/03/software-patent-eligibility.html,"
By Dennis Crouch 

Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, Supreme Court Docket No 13-298 (2014)

Later this term, the US Supreme Court will shift its focus toward the fundamental question of whether software and business methods are patentable. More particularly, because an outright ban is unlikely, the court’s more narrow focus will be on providing a further explanation of its non-statutory “abstract idea” test. The Supreme Court addressed this exclusionary test in its 2010 Bilski decision, although in unsatisfactory form. As Mark Lemley, et al., wrote in 2011: “the problem is that no one understands what makes an idea ‘abstract,’ and hence ineligible for patent protection.” Lemley, Risch, Sichelman, and Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 1315 (2011).

In this case, a fractured Federal Circuit found Alice Corp’s computer-related invention to be unpatentable as effectively claiming an abstract idea. See, U.S. Patent No. 7,725,375. In its petition for writ of certiorari, Alice presented the following question:

Whether claims to computer-implemented inventions – including claims to systems and machines, processes, and items of manufacture – are directed to patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 101 as interpreted by this Court.

Oral arguments are set for Mar 31, 2014 and a decision is expected by the end of June 2014. In addition to the parties, a host of amici has filed briefs in the case, including 11 briefs at the petition stage and 41 briefs on the merits. Although not a party to the lawsuit, the Solicitor General has filed a motion to participate in oral arguments and steal some of the accused-infringer’s time.

The invention: There are several patents at issue, but the ‘375 patent is an important starting point. Claim 1 is directed to a “data processing system” that includes a number of elements, including “a computer” configured to generate certain instructions, “electronically adjust” stored values, and send/receive data between both a “data storage unit” a “first party device.” The claims also include “computer program products” and computer implemented methods. The underlying purpose of the invention is to provide certain settlement risks during a time-extended transaction by creating a set of shadow credit and debit records that are monitored for sufficient potential funds and that – at a certain point in the transaction the shadow records are automatically and irrevocably shifted to the “real world.”

It is unclear to me what makes this invention novel or nonobvious and many believe that it would fail on those grounds. However, the sole legal hook for the appeal at this stage is subject matter eligibility. One thing that we do know is that CLS Bank is alleged to be using the patented invention to ensure settlement for more than a trillion dollars daily.

Important case: The claim structure here is quite similar to that seen in hundreds-of-thousands of already issued patents and pending patent applications where the advance in software engineering is a fairly straightforward, but is done in a way that has an important impact on the marketplace. One difference from many software patents is that the underlying functionality is to solve a business transaction problem. However, there is a likelihood that the decision will not turn (one way or the other) on that field-of-use limitation.  In his brief, Tony Dutra argues that the key here is utility, and that an advance in contract-settlement is not useful in the patent law context.

[Brief of the US Government] The most important brief in a pile such as this is often that filed by the U.S. Government. Here, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and USPTO Solicitor Nathan Kelley joined forces in filing their brief in support of CLS Bank and a broad reading of the abstract idea test. In particular, the U.S. Government argues that none of the claims discussed are subject matter eligible. The brief begins with an importance argument – that “the abstract idea exception is patent law’s sole mechanism for excluding claims directed to manipulation of non-technological concepts and relationships.” This notion – that the abstract idea is the final and ultimate bulwark – places a tremendous pressure on the Court to create a highly flexible test. In my view, the Government largely loses its credibility with that argument – somehow forgetting about the host of other overlapping patent law doctrines that each address this issue in their own way, including requirements that any patented invention be useful, enabled, described in definite claims, and nonobvious. The ultimate backstop is likely the US Constitutional statement regarding “Inventors” and their “Discoveries.”

The government brief goes on to endorse the approach of first identifying whether the claim would be abstract if the computer technology were removed from the method claims and, if so, move on to consider whether the computer technology limitations are sufficient to transform a non-patentable abstract idea into a sufficiently concrete innovation in technology, science, or the industrial arts. “The ultimate inquiry is whether the claims are directed to an innovation in computing or other technical fields.” The brief then reviews the precedent on this topic from Bilski, Mayo and Flook.

Addressing the computer system and software claims, the U.S. Government agrees that they are certainly directed toward “machines” and “manufactures.” However, according to the government, those claims to physical products are properly termed abstract ideas because the physical elements “do not add anything of substance.”

One interesting element from the brief is that the US Government notes that, although a question of law, invalidity for lack of subject matter eligibility requires clear and convincing evidence in order to overcome the presumption of validity. In its brief, CLS Bank argues otherwise as does Google, who actually takes time to cogently spell out the argument with citation to leading authorities.

[Brief of CLS Bank] In its merits brief, CLS Bank somewhat rewrote the question presented – focusing attention on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Mayo.

Question Re-framed: An abstract idea, including a fundamental economic concept, is not eligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. §101. Bilski v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. 3218 (2010). Adding conventional elements to an abstract idea does not render it patent-eligible. Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012). The asserted claim of the patents-in-suit recite the fundamental economic concept of intermediated settlement, implemented using conventional computer functions. The question presented is:

Whether the courts below correctly concluded that all of the asserted claims are not patent-eligible.

The basic setup of the CLS Bank is the argument that a newly discovered abstract idea coupled with conventional technology is not patent eligible. CLS Bank’s point is well taken that an outright win for Alice Corp. here would involve something of a disavowal rewriting of Mayo.

[Brief of Alice Corp.] Alice Corp’s brief obviously takes a different stance – and argues first that the non-statutory exceptions to patentability should be narrowly construed and focused on the purpose of granting patents on creations of human ingenuity and that the idea behind Alice’s invention is not the type of “preexisting, fundamental truth” that should be the subject of an abstract idea test. Alice also reiterated its position that the claimed invention should be examined as a whole rather than divided up as suggested by the Government brief.

[Brief of Trading Technologies, et al.] TT’s brief (joined by a group of 40 patent-holding software companies as well as Prof. Richard Epstein) argues that the “abstract idea” test is focused on scientific truths and scientific principles. In that construct, Alice Corp’s ideas regarding the settlement system would not be seen as ineligible. TT also challenges the court to think beyond the computer as “merely a calculator and that programming merely instructs the computer to perform basic mathematical calculations. “While this may have been true of many of the applications programmed on the earliest computers over 40 years ago, it is simply not the case today. . . . Viewing computers as merely calculators is completely disconnected from the reality of where innovation is occurring today and where most innovation will occur in the future.” In his brief, Dale Cook agrees and further makes the argument that a distinction between hardware and software is illusory – citing Aristotle to make his point. [Brief of Dale Cook]. Supporting that notion is the Microsoft brief that sees “software-enabled inventions” as the “modern-day heirs to mechanical inventions. [Brief of Microsoft HP]. Pushing back on this argument, Public Knowledge seemingly shows that the entire claimed method can be implemented in seven lines of software code. Thus, while some software is complex. PK makes the argument that the software at issue here is exceedingly simple.

TT also warns against the Government’s position that a strong eligibility guideline is needed in cases such as this. In particular, explains “inventions that do nothing more than use a computer to implement time-worn concepts in obvious and traditional ways will not receive patent protection notwithstanding the fact that they concern eligible subject matter. On that note, TT asks for clarification from the Supreme Court that “Mayo does not support importation of novelty, nonobviousness, and other patentability criteria into the ‘abstract idea’ analysis.”

[Brief of ABL] The final brief in support of petitioner was filed on behalf of Advanced Biological Labs by Robert Sachs. ABL argues that a claim should only be seen as problematic under the abstract idea test when there are no practical alternative non-infringing ways of practicing the abstract idea. On that point, ABL further pushes for the notion that the test should be considered from the framework of one skilled in the art rather than simply the-mind-of-the-judge and based upon clear and convincing evidence. Pushing back against this notion is the brief of the American Antitrust Institute (AAI) drafted by Professor Shubha Ghosh. The AAI argues that the purpose of the Abstract Idea exclusion is to prevent undue harm to competition and innovation. Seemingly, the AAI contends that a claim directed an abstract idea is per se anticompetitive and that even when coupled with technology it may still be unduly preemptive. Oddly however, later in the brief AAI argues for a test that is not based upon market competition or preemption.

[Shultz Love Brief] A leading brief on the side of ineligibility is that filed by Professors Jason Shultz and Bryan Love on behalf of about 22 other professors. The professors make the argument that the world would be a better place without software patents. For its conclusions, the brief largely relies on the work of Brian Love, Christina Mulligan, Colleen Chien, James Bessen, & Michael Meurer. The EFF brief from Professor Pamela Samuelson, Julie Samuels, and Michael Barclay make a parallel argument: “If anything, evidence shows that the U.S. software industry is harmed by the exponential growth of vague software patents.” Without denying the problems created by software patents, Professors Peter Menell and Jeff Lefstin argue that the solution is not to rely upon the “abstract idea” test to solve that problem. IBM offers the starkest contrast to the Shultz-Love brief – arguing that the failure to clearly offer patent rights for software inventions “endangers a critical part of our nation’s economy and threatens innovation.”

The ACLU has been more frequently involved with patent law issues and was a backer of the Myriad case. In its brief, the ACLU argues that the abstract idea exception is the patent law proxy for free speech and that monopolization of abstract ideas would be a violation of the First Amendment. That conclusion is supported by the Software Freedom Law Center & Eben Moglen. The First Amendment argument has the potential of twisting on the ACLU: if the justices fail to see that patents create any First Amendment concern then they may be more likely to support a narrowing of the abstract idea exception. Notably, in the most recent patent law oral arguments on fee-shifting, Justice Roberts arguably suggested that patents did not create any first amendment concerns.

I mentioned Microsoft’s brief earlier. Microsoft argues that software should be patentable – but not the software in this case. In particular, Microsoft agrees with the notion that simply adding “a computer” to an otherwise abstract idea does not fix the problem. Microsoft’s solution is to consider “whether the claim as a whole recites a specific, practical application of the idea rather than merely reciting steps inherent in the idea itself.” Microsoft goes on to admit that its test adds little predictability.

The Intellectual Property Owners Association and AIPLA similarly argue that software “if properly claimed” is patent eligible. On its face, that argument may not sit well with the Court who may see the “as claimed” notion designed to create loopholes for sly patent drafters whose noses are made of wax. A collective brief from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others support this notion that patent eligibility should not turn on “clever drafting.” On an ancillary (but important) point Google argues that Section 101 defenses should be considered at the outset of most cases. cf. Crouch & Merges, Operating Efficiently Post-Bilski by Ordering Patent Doctrine Decision-Making.

Challenging Alice at the Supreme Court? | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/11/challenging-alice-supreme.html,"
Recognicorp v. Nintendo (Supreme Court 2017) [RecogPetition]
The new Supreme Court petition for writ of certiorari asks the following questions:
In Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014), the Court set forth a two-step test for determining whether computer-implemented inventions claim patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101. First, a court must determine whether the claims at issue are “directed to” an abstract idea. Second, if the claims are “directed to” an abstract idea, the court must then determine whether the claims recite inventive concepts — elements which ensure that the patent amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the abstract idea itself.
The questions presented are:
1. Whether computer-implemented inventions that provide specific improvements to existing technological processes for encoding or decoding data are patent-eligible under the first step of the Alice test, even if those inventions involve or make use of abstract ideas.
2. Whether the use of new mathematical algorithms to improve existing technological processes by reducing bandwidth and memory usage can constitute “inventive concepts” under the second step of the Alice test.
The patent at issue here is U.S. Patent No. 8,005,303 that is generally directed toward a mechanism for creating a composite image.  In the brief, the patentee explains that the method allows the use of “composite facial image codes” to represent a face.
Claim 1. A method for creating a composite image, comprising:
displaying facial feature images on a first area of a first display …, wherein the facial feature images are associated with facial feature element codes;
selecting a facial feature image from the first area … via a user interface …
wherein the first device incorporates the selected facial feature image into a composite image …, wherein the composite image is associated with a composite facial image code … wherein the composite facial image code is derived by performing at least one multiplication operation on a facial code using one or more code factors as input parameters …; and
reproducing the composite image on a second display based on the composite facial image code.
After reading through this claim, I’ll give this petition approximately 0% of winning.

New Guidelines Suggest a Return to Strong Patent Rights - Inventors Digest,https://www.inventorsdigest.com/articles/new-guidelines-suggest-return-strong-patent-rights/,"
Last month, I commented about some recent cases for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District that seemed to open the first chink in the Alice armor. As a refresher, the Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International is the one that —along with its progeny from lower courts—eviscerated most software patents and many other categories of inventions on the premise that they merely reflect “abstract ideas.” However, these recent cases open the door for trial by jury, removing judgment by summary motion and giving deprived patent owners their date in court.
Enter Andrei Iancu, newly appointed director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, who wasted no time attacking this pivotal issue head-on. In his first (and highly anticipated) public speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on April 11, he left no doubt that he thought the pendulum had swung too far against patent owners and that his priority going forward was to “1. create a new pro-innovation, pro-IP dialogue, and 2. increase the reliability of the patent grant.”
But Director Iancu wasn’t done there. Not long afterward, when testifying before Congress, he made no bones that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board is also ripe for reform. (This situation presumably remains, even after the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Oil States v. Greene’s Energy Group that upheld the constitutionality of inter partes review—the right to reconsider and cancel an issued patent.) Some statements he made in front of the Senate Committee:
“We are reviewing (PTAB proceedings) carefully to ensure that the agency’s approach to these critical proceedings is consistent with the intent of the AIA (2011 America Invents Act) and the overall goal of ensuring predictable, high-quality patent rights. We are currently studying, among other things, the institution decision, claim construction, the amendment process, composition of judging panels, the conduct of hearings and the variety of standard operating procedures.”
Wow! Anything is on the table, it would appear. And here is another statement pertaining to software inventions that should cause many supporters to rejoice. When asked whether algorithms were mathematical representations of laws of nature, Iancu said: “You’re getting right to the heart of the issue. This is one place where I believe courts have gone off the initial intent. There are human-made algorithms, human-made algorithms that are the result of human ingenuity that are not set from time immemorial and that are not absolutes; they depend on human choices. Those are very different from E=mc2 and they are very different from the Pythagorean theorem, for example.”
Last but not least, under the new director’s impetus, in mid-April the USPTO made public  new guidelines for examiners’ use when handling Article 101 (“abstract idea”) rejections. These guidelines put a much heavier burden on patent office examiners when wanting to rule on the issue, whereas that burden sat squarely on the inventor in recent years.
If you combine this new guideline with the recent case law on Alice and other recent court decisions making the routine finding of obviousness from the PTAB a lot more difficult going forward, this looks like the first major and substantive changes that we have witnessed in the past few years that trend toward reinforcing patent rights in the United States!
As such, expect to see an uptick in patent valuations during the next few months, since most of the current values are a direct reflection of the relative uncertainty regarding patent validity as a result of Alice and the PTAB practice. A weakening of these two forces will only help restore confidence in the patent system and in the value of patents themselves.
Despite some negative reaction to the Oil States decision—some were hoping for a dismantling of the PTAB—other recent events have undoubtedly given cause for patent inventors and holders to feel pretty good for the first time in a long time about where the arrows are pointing. We can only hope that companies that practice those patents will see the writing on the wall and revert to a more rational way of approaching licensing discussions, other than the usual “Sue me” that has become their signature response.
Buyers and sellers
On April 10, the USPTO made public an assignment of more than 400 patent assets from Intellectual Ventures LLC to Vista Peak Ventures, LLC, an affiliate of Dominion Harbor Enterprises, LLC. This transfer appears to be part of a larger transaction announced by Dominion in February, involving more than 1,200 U.S. and foreign LCD patents originating with NEC.
Winners and losers
The eight-year legal battle that plagued Apple and VirnetX has finally ended. Apple was ordered to pay more than $500 million in damages to VirnetX over Facetime and IMessage patents. However, VirnetX, a non-practicing entity (holder of a patent for a product or process with no intention of developing it), may want to wait on the champagne. The case is likely to go to appeal. …
Alice struck again as Nike, Fitbit and GoPro, to name a few, won a lawsuit at the district court level on the basis that the alleged patent infringer relied on abstract ideas and not inventive concepts. … Yamaha won its battle against inventor Ira Pazandeh concerning alleged infringement of a loudspeaker patent. The federal circuit court maintained the non-infringement judgment for Yamaha and additionally awarded attorney fees to the Japanese manufacturer. …
Ugg, the cozy-boots shoemaker, was awarded $5.2 million from a jury to make up for damages for a design patent infringement claim. The jury found that Romeo and Juliette Inc. had infringed a three-side-buttons design patent by Ugg and was required to attribute $3.1 million dollars of profits associated with those sales. …
Funai Corp., a Japanese company that markets television for Sanyo, won its case against Maxon LLC. Maxon accused Sanyo’s smart TVs of infringing methods of controlling entertainment subscriptions. The unanimous three-judge panel, at the appellate court, found that the patents asserted abstract ideas and therefore were invalidated.
I’ll see you in court
The Oracle v. Google saga continues as the federal circuit reversed the district court’s decision, sending the parties on their way to a third trial. This time, the appellate court disagreed with the trial court’s finding that Google’s use of the JAVA APIs constituted fair use. Oracle is seeking a payout of several billions of dollars. …
Snapchat is again in hot water, accused of infringing six messaging technology patents belonging to Blackberry. This is the second significant suit for Blackberry, which went after Facebook earlier this year for similar infringement.
Social Handshakes…or Earthquakes
Speaking of Facebook, April was a rough month for the social media giant. If the privacy breach wasn’t bad enough, in order to focus on Mark Zuckerberg’s Supreme Court hearing, the company settled its trade secrets case against Bladeroom for $365 million.
It’s always nice to see companies playing nicely in the figurative sandbox. In that spirit, TiVo and Mediacom agreed to expand and extend their licensing agreement. Both parties seem to complement each other, as one recognizes the innovations produced by its counterpart as being of value for its customer’s entertainment experience. …
Kyocera, a pioneer in mobile telecommunications devices, closed a multi-year patent licensing deal with InterDigital. Although details of the agreement remain secret, it appears that the deal comprises a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license on terminal unit products. … BlackBird and Capital One settled their lawsuit about three patents that relate to “methods for securely authorizing online transactions.” … While in mediation, AT&T and Bascom Internet Services Inc. decided to settle the alleged infringement case related to internet filtering.
Around the world
Asia: In a landmark decision, the Beijing IP Court ordered a permanent injunction for the first time in history against Sony. The court determined that Sony had infringed a Standard Essential Patent (SEP) related to wireless connectivity (WAPI) held by Iwncomm. The court discussed the limitations of FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) licensing terms as a defense, the SEP injunctions threshold, and the damages calculation for past infringement. …
The United States and Japan joined forces in a complaint against China in front of the World Trade Organization. Japan is also seeking remedies against China’s alleged theft of intellectual property and the Chinese government’s purported discriminatory treatment of foreign patent holders. China retaliated with yet another tariff of its own.
The Chinese government has released new Patent Transfer Guidelines in hopes of securing a transparent business environment between Chinese and foreign companies/investors. The government is set only to review two categories of IP transfers: technology restricted for exports and international acquisitions of Chinese enterprises.
I recently addressed the impact of new technologies such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the IP realm. As previously discussed, many U.S. companies have shown serious interest in acquiring IP rights in this field, particularly with blockchain technology. However, Chinese companies took note and in 2017 filed roughly half of all blockchain patent applications.
Europe: The demand for European patents hit an all-time high in 2017—up 3.9 percent, according to the European Patent Office. Rankings for the most active EP filers based on country of origin show the United States back on top in 2017 after what we assume was a slump caused by U.S. patent legislation in 2013.
Close on the heels of the United States were Germany, Japan and China. The EPO attributes the growth to the agency’s “sustained effort to boost (patent) quality and (the EPO’s) efficiency.” Does the United States have something else to learn from the EU?

"No, you can’t patent the ability to pause a lesson recording, EFF says | Ars Technica",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/no-you-cant-patent-the-ability-to-pause-a-lesson-recording-eff-says/,"


 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has stepped up to represent a small, independent online language teacher who has been threatened with a lawsuit by a British publisher that claims the teacher is infringing an American patent issued back in 2003 for a particular audio-based teaching technique.
What's the secret sauce? Amazingly, the use of a pause button to temporarily stop the lesson.
The Barcelona-based teacher, Mihalis Eleftheriou, runs a website known as ""Language Transfer,"" where he offers free online courses in French, Turkish, Greek, and many other languages. The site has no advertising, and he told Ars recently that about 400 people per month donate a collective $1,800 to help defray ongoing costs.
""I'm not a company, I'm not anything, I'm just a guy, a poor guy,"" he said.
A Virginia attorney, Christopher Foley, representing publisher Hodder & Stoughton, recently demanded that Eleftheriou halt any publication of audio lessons in the United States or face a potential lawsuit.
Hodder & Stoughton claims to represent the ""exclusive licensee"" of a patent originally granted to a now-deceased French teacher, Michel Thomas. The Polish immigrant, who lived for decades in the United States, claimed that he could teach anyone the basics of a European language that had commonalities with English to anyone in ""a matter of days or a week."" He attracted numerous celebrity clients, including Woody Allen and Bill Murray.
Eleftheriou said that he was not ""reproducing"" Thomas' method, adding that ""nothing else [is] as well thought-out"" as Eleftheriou's own technique.
But however effective Thomas' teaching technique may or may not have been, it was not patentable, according to a scathing letter sent on July 2, 2018 by Daniel Nazer, an EFF attorney who is representing Eleftheriou.
Nazer wrote in his letter that, under a 2014 Supreme Court decision known as Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, ""an abstract idea does not become eligible for patent protection merely by being implemented on generic or conventional technology.""
According to Thomas' patent filing itself, ""the technique involves a process through which a student, for each of a set of expressions listens to a recorded expression in the home language, and then with a pause under control of the student, translates the expressions into the target language.""
It goes on:
A pause button is provided to the target student on the machine in which the tape or recorded medium is played so that the student can initiate a pause after the initial statement of the expression in the home language. This gives the student time to think of his or her translation before proceeding. Indeed, the student can pause at any stage of the proceeding in order to maintain a personal pace without ever experiencing stress, strain or pressure.
Nazer excoriated the '358 patent, noting that the ""use of a stop or pause button cannot save"" it, adding that a pause button was ""generic technology"" that long predated the patent's issuance in 2003.
""Moreover, a student pausing a lesson at home is merely the learn-at-home equivalent of a student asking a teacher for an extra moment to solve a problem,"" he added.
Eleftheriou agreed.
""It's kind of ridiculous that they think that they can patent using the pause button,"" he said. ""There [are] no grounds for this, and if [the publisher's] lawyers had listened to two minutes of my courses, they would have realized this.""
Foley did not respond to Ars' multiple requests for comment.

Eligibility Rejections Appearing with Greater Frequency at USPTO,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/05/24/eligibility-rejections-greater-frequency-uspto/id=97615/,"
The frequency of any particular rejection type may be influenced by seminal Federal Circuit and Supreme Court cases. Judicial decisions are interpreted into policy decisions by the United States Patent Office (USPTO) and distributed to patent examiners in the form of examination guidance memoranda and other training materials. At least initially, major changes in jurisprudence are more likely to burden applications in the technological art analyzed by the court than applications in other arts as the USPTO will extend the courts analysis to those applications pending in that technological art. Yet, as the dust settles, the full impact of these decisions may be seen across all technology centers (TCs) of the USPTO.
A great example of a decision that materially affected the frequency of a particular rejection type was the 2014 Alice v. CLS Bank decision.[1] The Court in Alice reasoned that abstract ideas merely embodied on a generic computer are not eligible for patent protection.[2] Almost immediately after Alice, the USPTO began issuing new subject-matter eligibility rejections under the abstract-idea exception to the statutory categories of patent eligibility. The ubiquity of subject-matter eligibility rejections in office actions exploded, leading many to wonder whether software implemented inventions remained patentable at all.
This effect was largely centered in business method art units of TC 3600. For example, the number of allowances issued from business-method art units dropped from 24% in the months before Alice was decided to about 3% in months after.[3] Though more recent analysis identified an uptick in allowances in the business-method art units, the probability of receiving an allowance remained about four to five times lower when compared to the probabilities in other technology areas.[4] Many of the court decisions holding claims to be ineligible were from patents having been issued from these art units, so it is not particularly surprising that the USPTO focused immediate post-Alice training in these art units.
Examiners have not been the only obstacle to securing patents for business-method technologies. For example, we recently analyzed Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ex parte appeal decisions having had Appeal Briefs filed after the Alice decision. We reviewed PTAB decisions from computer related technology centers, including TCs 2100, 2400, 2600 and the business method portion of TC 3600. Nearly all eligibility rejections at issue stemmed from the business-method art units[5], and a mere 7% of those appeals were successful (i.e. reversed).[6] Thus, the Alice decision had a significant impact on the applications from business method art units.
Eligibility Rejections are Appearing with Greater Frequency in Non-Business Method Technology Centers
Our previous studies of regular prosecution and appeals suggested that Alice was rather inconsequential to patenting prospects for other computer-related technology areas. However, recent anecdotal accounts from practitioners suggest that eligibility rejections are becoming more common in the other TCs. Further, it appears as though the USPTO has increased training on Alice and eligibility assessments in the other TCs.
Thus, we collected new data to determine whether eligibility rejections have statistically increased in TC 2100, 2400 and 2600: Using LexisNexis® PatentAdvisorSM, we analyzed all office actions issued by the USPTO during each of the following time periods:

October 1, 2017-December 31, 2017;
January 1-14, 2017;
January 1-14, 2016;
January 1-14, 2015;
January 1-14, 2014; and
January 1-14, 2013.

Specifically, for each office action, we tracked (using LexisNexis® PatentAdvisorSM data) the associated art unit and which types of rejections were issued. We separated the office actions by TC (further separating TC 3600 into the business-method art units (“BizMeth”) or other art units (“Other 3600”)) and by date of issuance.
 
Fig. 1: Percentage of office actions that include a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 101.
Notably, the prevalence of the eligibility rejections in TCs 2100, 2400, and 2600 still remains small compared to that in the business-method art units. Consistent with our previous results[7], our present analysis shows that there was a nearly immediate post-Alice jump in the percentage of office actions from business method art units that included a subject-matter eligibility rejection. In the six months after Alice was decided, the percentage of office actions including an eligibility rejection from business method art units increased by 258%. Any increase in the percentage of eligibility rejections observed for other TCs was negligible. Further consistent with our previous results[8], since 2015, the percentage of office actions with eligibility rejections from business-method art units has seen a small year-over-year decline. Thus, the timing characteristics trends relating to the business-method art units differ substantially relative to the other TCs. Nearly immediately since Alice, the prevalence of eligibility rejections in the business-method art units substantially increased and has shown modest changes since, while the prevalence of eligibility rejections in other computer-related TCs remained rather constant across the Alice-decision timer period, though recent shifts are substantial.
This data shows that the prevalence of eligibility rejections in non-business-method computer-related TCs (e.g., 2100, 2400, and 2600) has increased after Alice, though this increased prevalence is only associated with recent time periods. Across the first two weeks of 2014 (prior to the Alice decision), 12.3% of the office actions issued across TCs 2100, 2400 and 2600 included an eligibility rejection. Three years later, and about 2 ½ years after the Alice decision, the percentage notched higher to 14.6% by the beginning of 2017. But by October of 2017, the prevalence jumped to 25.0% (and was 29.3% by December of 2017). Thus, the prevalence of eligibility rejections doubled across 2017, while it had remained substantially constant for years after Alice. 
Conclusions
Four years after the Alice decision, we seem to just now be detecting the full impact of the decision. The initial response by the USPTO resulted in an somewhat expected increase in the percentage of applications with eligibility rejections from business-method art units. Three years after Alice, eligibility rejections became much more common across the remaining computer-related technology centers (i.e. 2100, 2400, and 2600). However, while the percentage of applications with eligibility rejections from the computer-related technology centers is much higher now than three years ago, the percentage is unlikely to increase to the percentage of applications with eligibility rejections from the business-method art units.
The sudden increase in eligibility rejections from other computer-related technology centers may have a number of causes. For example, case law from the Federal Circuit and the USTPO began to expanded the application of Alice to inventions that appear abstract despite not being directed to a traditional business-method concept.  In the first few months after Alice, the USPTO trained examiners to identify abstract ideas based on a claim being similar to claims the courts had already found to be abstract.  Initially, the PTAB and Federal Circuit decisions analyzed few, if any, non-business-method patents under the Alice framework. Thus, having few, if any, cases for comparison, non-business-method art units found few applications abstract.  The recent increase may be due to the PTAB and Federal Circuit analyzing more applications and patents in the technological arts examined in TCs 2100, 2400, and 2600.[9]
Another possible cause for the increase in eligibility rejections may be the uneven training given to examiners. As the subject matter of Alice, as well the cases decided shortly thereafter by the PTAB and Federal Circuit, frequently corresponded to the subject matter examined by the business-method art units, the USPTO likely focused the initial eligibility training effort on business-method examiners. As the number of post-Alice PTAB and Federal Circuit eligibility expanded, so did the USPTO’s training efforts which used the extra case law to provide better guidance to examiners outside the business-method art units. Therefore, the recent surge in eligibility rejections from TCS 2100, 2400, and 2600 may be caused by the USPTO’s increased training efforts in these areas.
The increase in the percentage of office actions with eligibility rejections in TC 2100 was much higher than the increase in other computer related technology centers TC 2400 and TC 2600. Given that TC 2100 is a primarily software-focused technology center, this trend discrepancy suggests that post-Alice eligibility assessments performed by software examiners present increased challenges for patenting software based inventions.[10] In business-method art units, we have seen many applicants turn to appeal to address eligibility rejections that cannot be resolved with the examiner.[11] It remains to be seen whether the increase in eligibility rejections from the computer-related technology centers will trigger a similar increase in appeals in these technology centers. Thus, we may not yet be seeing the full effect of Alice on the patent prosecution landscape: it will be telling to track the prosecutions of applications that are now rejected under § 101 in TC 2100 (e.g., to determine an extent to which they are likely to become abandoned, to resort to an appeal, to receive additional office actions before an allowance, etc.).  In the meantime, in the words of the USPTO Director Andrei Iancu: “it is unclear what is patentable and what is not, and that can depress innovation”.[12]

Saved by Alice | Electronic Frontier Foundation,https://www.eff.org/alice,"In Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court ruled that an abstract idea does not become eligible for a patent simply by being implemented on a generic computer. This 2014 decision has significantly reduced the harm caused by vague and overbroad software patents. Before Alice, patent owners who had contributed little to the development of technology could lock up common sense business practices with patents. These kinds of software patents were especially popular with patent trolls who used them to attack startups and other productive companies. Alice is a crucial tool for fighting back against these patent trolls.
This project collects stories from people whose businesses were helped, or even saved, by the Supreme Court’s Alice decision. These businesses range from sole-proprietorships, to mid-size startups, to large software companies. In each case, the business was threatened by a patent owner asserting a highly abstract software patent. Most were able to defend themselves by raising Alice early in the litigation. Without Alice, it is likely many would have not survived the high cost of patent litigation.
A few loud voices in the patent lobby are asking Congress to amend Section 101 of the Patent Act to overturn Alice. For example, the Intellectual Property Owners Association wants make anything eligible for patent protection unless it exists in nature independently or “exists solely in the human mind.” This would open the floodgates to patents that simply tie an abstract idea to a generic computer. Without a sensible limit on patent eligibility, any business method that incorporates a computer, however tangentially, could be covered by a patent. Even IBM’s infamous patent application on shorter meetings, rejected under Section 101, would now be eligible for a 20-year government-granted monopoly.
There’s no evidence that overturning Alice in this way would benefit the public or innovation. To the contrary, Alice has helped many companies like those featured here. At the same time, the ruling has not harmed software development. In fact, investment in software R&D was growing fast before Alice, and grew even faster after the decision.
Ultimately, Alice recognizes the long-standing policy that patents should not take more benefit from the public than they contribute to the public store of knowledge. The decision should be applauded and defended. The stories collected here show Alice in action protecting real businesses against silly patents.

Patent Docs: Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l: Alice's Supreme Court Brief,http://www.patentdocs.org/2014/03/alice-corp-v-cls-bank-intl-alices-supreme-court-brief.html,"
By Michael Borella --
On December 6th, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to a case that presents the question of ""[w]hether claims to computer-implemented inventions -- including claims to systems and machines, processes, and items of manufacture -- are directed to patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 101 as interpreted by this Court?""  Thus, for the third time in five years, the highest court will once again review the patent-eligibility of so-called software and business method patents.
This case was likely destined the Supreme Court once the Federal Circuit released its six-opinion en banc decision this May, demonstrating a severe intra-circuit split.  Judge Lourie's concurrence read Justice Breyer's 2012 Mayo v. Prometheus opinion in view of former Justice Stevens' 1978 Parker v. Flook decision, the latter a case that some thought had been in part overturned by 1980's Diamond v. Diehr and 2010's Bilski v. Kappos.  In Mayo, however, Justice Breyer resurrected the ""inventive concept"" analysis of Flook, and its propensity to blur the lines between the inquiries of patent-eligible subject matter, anticipation, and obviousness.
In applying this analysis in CLS Bank, Judge Lourie set forth a procedure for analyzing claims that incorporate abstract ideas.  Since then, it has been roundly criticized for failing to produce an objective, workable standard.  Chief Judge Rader wrote separately, taking an approach that attempted to apply the inventive concept analysis while keeping § 101 separate from considerations of prior art.  Other panel opinions took different methodologies, relying on procedural issues to tip the scales, or advocating a dramatic reduction in scope of the judicial exceptions to § 101.
Regardless, the en banc panel did little to clarify the bounds of patent-eligible subject matter, and may have muddied the waters even further.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that the Supreme Court has taken up this case.  Hopefully, the Justices will clarify whether prior art should be considered in a 35 U.S.C. § 101 analysis, whether such an analysis should be applied to claims as a whole or to claim elements on a piecemeal basis, and whether recitation of general-purpose computer hardware (either as a claim element or as the statutory type of the claim) makes a claim any less abstract.  Or, being the Supreme Court, it is within their purview to decide the case on much narrower grounds.
Now that the case has been fully briefed, we can look to the parties for the positions that they will likely be taking during oral argument.
Brief Overview of the Case
In 2007, CLS Bank filed a declaratory judgment action against Alice, contending that, among other things, Alice's U.S. Patents Nos. 5,970,479, 6,912,510, and 7,149,720 were invalid under § 101.  Alice filed counterclaims alleging infringement of these three patents.  Later, Alice's U.S. Patent No. 7,725,375 was added to the action, and the parties respectively asserted invalidity and infringement contentions for this patent as well.
All four patents are from the same family and ""share substantially the same specification.""  The Federal Circuit plurality described the claimed subject matter as:
[A] computerized trading platform used for conducting financial transactions in which a third party settles obligations between a first and a second party so as to eliminate ""counterparty"" or ""settlement"" risk . . . .   Settlement risk refers to the risk to each party in an exchange that only one of the two parties will actually pay its obligation, leaving the paying party without its principal or the benefit of the counterparty's performance.  Alice's patents address that risk by relying on a trusted third party to ensure the exchange of either both parties' obligations or neither obligation.
Between the four patents, method, computer-readable medium (CRM), and system claims were asserted.  The parties stipulated that all claims, including the method claims, require ""a computer including at least a processor and memory"" and electronic implementation.
The District Court held that all asserted claims failed to meet the requirements of § 101, and thus were invalid.  Particularly, the District Court concluded that the method claims were directed to an unpatentable abstract idea, and that the CRM and system claims would similarly preempt all practical applications of this idea, despite those claims falling under a different statutory category.
On appeal, a Federal Circuit panel reversed the District Court on all counts, holding that all claims, including the method claims, were patent eligible under § 101.  CLS Bank petitioned the full Federal Circuit for review, which was granted.  Sitting en banc, seven of the ten judges overruled the panel and affirmed the District Court's ruling regarding the method and CRM claims.   However, this majority did not agree on the rationale for their conclusion.  Further, five of the judges found that the system claims were unpatentable, while the other five concluded that these claims passed muster under § 101.  Additionally, eight of the judges indicated that the method, CRM, and system claims must rise or fall together.
Alice's Brief
After the en banc Federal Circuit decision, Alice found itself in a difficult position.  To obtain a favorable Supreme Court review, it has to thread the eye of a needle by arguing that the Federal Circuit has left the law in a state of disarray, without suggesting that this disarray stems from the Supreme Court's own 2012 Mayo ruling.  Also, Alice has to distinguish its method claims over those that the Court struck down in Bilski, despite a high-level similarity thereto.
Alice began its substantive analysis by noting that while the requirements of §§ 102, 103, and 112 must be met for a patent to be valid, subject matter eligibility was the solely the province of § 101.  Alice quoted Judge Rich, ""[a]chieving the ultimate goal of a patent [requires] having the separate keys to open in succession the three doors of sections 101, 102, and 103.""  Thus, Alice signaled early that it was going to lean on Diehr as the controlling precedent.
In presenting its claims, Alice wisely chose a system claim, claim 26 of the '375 patent, to discuss first.  This claim explicitly recites a computer, coupled to a communications controller and data storage, which communicates with a separate device.  Clearly, this claim recites tangible, physical hardware.  Alice also presented claim 33 of the '479 patent as a representative method claim.  However, this method claim is disembodied, and does not explicitly recite any physical hardware.  Instead, Alice contended that ""a person of skill in the art would understand the methods, as claimed, to require use of a computer.""  As noted above, this was also stipulated to by both parties in the district court proceedings.  Alice also briefly discussed its CRM claims, noting that the media is what allows the claimed systems to use the claimed methods.
In its review of the case so far, Alice took the opportunity to poke at Judge Lourie's plurality opinion.  For instance, Alice, pointed out that Judge Lourie ""look[ed] past the claim language"" when conducting his piecemeal inventive concept analysis, and re-emphasized that ""claims must be considered as a whole.""  This sets the stage for Alice's later attempts to drive a wedge between Justice Breyer's Mayo analysis and the approach of the Federal Circuit's plurality.
Alice's substantive argument consists of three main parts: (i) defining the ""abstract idea"" exception to § 101 and contrasting it to patent-eligible disembodied concepts, (ii) reiterating that claims must be read as a whole, and (iii) asserting that, regardless of whether Alice's claims encompass abstract ideas, they are patent-eligible.
Alice began its discussion of abstract ideas by noting that, unlike laws of nature and physical phenomena, the Court has never clearly defined what it means by that term.  However, in Alice's view, the Court has treated abstract ideas substantively the same as it has treated laws of nature.  Both are fundamental truths that reflect ""relationship[s] that [have] always existed"" and therefore are ""part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.""  In other words, abstract ideas were not created or invented by humans, and are instead fundamental aspects of the universe that belong in the public domain.
Discovery of an abstract idea, such as ""mathematical formulas and the like,"" in and of itself does not warrant a patent for the discoverer.  Instead, ""[w]hen a patent claim recites such an abstract idea, it can be patented only if the claim includes other elements or steps that go beyond the fundamental truth itself, thus limiting the claimed invention to a specific application and preserving public access to the fundamental truth.""  Claiming a use of an abstract idea in a particular field does not lift the claim to the level of being patent-eligible, as no one is entitled to foreclose others' use of this public domain knowledge.
Alice painted a picture in which Gottschalk v. Benson and Flook were decided in order to avoid the preemption of an abstract idea.  In these cases, the claimed abstract ideas were both algorithms, rather and mathematical relationships, but still were considered laws of nature.  Moving on to Bilski, Alice couched that case's claims as also being an algorithmic abstract idea.  Particularly, Alice pointed to the Court's statement that Bilski's ""[c]laim 4 puts the concept articulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.""
To contrast with abstract ideas, Alice introduced the notion of ""disembodied concepts.""  In Alice's assessment, a disembodied concept does not fall into any of the four statutory categories of § 101, and instead is a ""pure mental conception.""  All claimed inventions involve, in one way or another, disembodied concepts.  The language of the claim is what makes these concepts statutory.  Further, and important to Alice's argument, a disembodied concept need not be an abstract idea or a law of nature, and therefore it is inappropriate to conduct a preemption analysis on such a claim.  Therefore, Judge Lourie's approach of asking whether such an ""inventive [disembodied] concept"" is wrapped up in a claim will always be answered in the affirmative, rendering his analysis to be excessively restrictive.
Alice moved on to a related topic, that all claims, whether reciting an abstract idea or not, must be read as a whole.  Alice noted that the Court has found it ""improper to look to the 'heart' or 'gist' of an invention, rather than the actual invention as described in the claim's language.""  Instead, all of the claim's limitations and terms must be considered, because this language defined the boundaries that the ""PTO has actually found deserving of a patent and what the public may not use.""  Thus, as noted in Diehr, ""[t]he 'novelty' of any element or steps in a process, or even of the process itself, is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within [§ 101].""
In order to drive this point home, Alice needed to synthesize the seeming discrepancies between Diehr and Mayo.  In doing so, Alice noted that, like Flook, the claim under consideration in Mayo recited an algorithm for exploiting a law of nature, and that the claim covered all practical uses of this law of nature.  Thus, the ""inventive concept"" analysis of Mayo does not advocate dividing the claim into abstract and non-abstract elements, because in Mayo the claim was considered as a whole.  Thus, Alice purported that the Court in Mayo did not overrule Diehr, but instead ""the 'inventive concept' inquiry asks whether additional steps in a claim that on its face recites a law of nature or fundamental truth do anything more than simply say 'apply it.'""
From all this, Alice concluded that computer-implemented inventions are necessarily physical embodiments, and that such an invention that would ""preempt use of a mathematical formula or other fundamental truth -- as did the inventions in Benson and Flook -- is ineligible for patenting.""  However, computer-implemented inventions that do not exhibit such preemption are patent-eligible.
Alice set forth a two-part test for determining the patent-eligibility of computer-implemented inventions:
If the claim does not, on its face, recite a mathematical formula or other fundamental truth, it is eligible.
[I]f the claim recites a particular application of a mathematical formula, such that others would not be foreclosed from using the formula in other practical applications, it is eligible.
Alice reminded the Court that such a test is merely a threshold test for § 101 purposes.  Sections 102, 103, and 112 prevent patents from claiming inventions too broadly or without enough specificity.
Finally, Alice argued that its claims were valid under § 101.  Alice noted that unlike Benson, Flook, and Bilski, Alice's claims had been allowed and issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Therefore, they enjoyed the presumption of validity, which saddled a high burden of proof on CLS Bank to establish otherwise.
Alice first argued that its claims are not directed to an abstract idea because they do not recite a mathematical formula, or a fundamental truth that can be reduced to a mathematical formula.  Thus, by default, Alice's claims cannot preempt others' uses of abstract ideas.  Alice contended that Judge Lourie held otherwise because Alice's method claims were drawn to a disembodied concept, and that he failed to appreciate the difference between such a concept and an abstract idea.
Alice also took issue with the lower court's ""paraphrasing and dissecting the language of Alice's claims in its hunt for a disembodied concept, instead of reviewing the claims as a whole and as written.""  Alice blamed this approach for ""untethering"" the claims from the recited real-world application.  Again, Alice emphasized that even their disembodied method claims were understood to require an unclaimed computer implementation, which Judge Lourie improperly ignored.
In the alternative, Alice asserted that even if its claims encompassed an abstract idea, they are directed to the specific application of using a computer as the intermediary for third-party escrow transactions.  Alice pointed out that ""a differently designed computer system could implement exchanges in other ways,"" and provided several examples thereof.  Thus, at worst, Alice's claims are similar to those of Diehr, where an abstract idea is invoked, but the claim as a whole does not preempt all uses of that idea in any particular field.
Analysis
Alice's main difficulty is that its method claims are similar in both structure and content to those of Bilski, and the Court may not believe that it is appropriate to hold that Alice's claims meet the § 101 requirements when Bilski's did not.  The Court might not defer to the stipulation that these disembodied method claims must be performed by a computer -- the claims, on their face, could be performed between humans, perhaps with the assistance of pencil and paper.
On the other hand, the Court should have a hard time concluding that Alice's system claims fail to pass muster under § 101, because doing so will put hundreds of thousands of similarly-claimed patented inventions at risk of being rendered invalid.  It is unlikely that the Court will want to stir the pot to such a degree without a clear signal from Congress that software and business methods should be frowned upon.
Alice's abstract idea / disembodied concept dichotomy is a clever approach that could potentially be adopted by the Court in some form.  It appeals to logic, and frames the Court's previous decisions in a consistent fashion.  The wildcard is whether Alice's understanding of Mayo agrees with that of its author.  Justice Breyer might respond to Alice's interpretation by saying, ""That's not what I meant.""  Such a statement would throw the proverbial spanner in Alice's gears.
Lastly, students of computer science -- indeed anyone who has ever used a computer -- might be entertained by Alice's seven-paragraph argument that a computer is a physical machine.  Alice has raised stating the obvious to a form of art.  Too bad that such an exercise is necessary in 2014.

Federal Circuit rules Alice did not alter the law governing 101,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/05/02/federal-circuit-rules-alice-did-not-alter-law-governing-101/id=96581/,"
On April 20, 2018, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Voter Verified, Inc. v. Election Sys. & Software LLC, a case arising from an appeal by Voter Verified, Inc. from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida’s dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) of its claim for patent infringement. The district court held that the claims of U.S. Reissue Patent RE40,449 (“the ‘449 patent”) are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter and, therefore, are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Federal Circuit, in a decision authored by Judge Lourie, joined by Judges Newman and Reyna, affirmed.
The parties previously litigated the same patent, in a dispute dating back to 2009-2010. In that prior litigation the defendant argued that the patent was directed to ineligible subject matter. In a series of summary judgment orders during the previous litigation, the district court made validity and infringement decisions. The district court determined that claims 1-93 were not infringed and claim 94 were invalid as indefinite under § 112. The district court then entered summary judgment in favor of Voter Verified concluding that all the claims of the ‘449 patent, except for claim 94, were not invalid under §§ 101 and 112, because Election Systems failed to present any arguments or evidence regarding invalidity of these claims. Finally, the district court dismissed without prejudice the claim of invalidity of claims 85 and 93 under § 102, having already determined that they were not infringed, but held that claim 49 was invalid under § 103, even though the district court had also already determined that it was not infringed.



In the current litigation, which was filed by Voter Verified in 2016, subject matter eligibility was again raised during motions on the pleadings. In response, Voter Verified argued that issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, precluded Election Systems from relitigating patent eligibility, which it argued had already been decided in the prior litigation. Election Systems argued that issue preclusion should not apply because there had been an intervening change in the law (i.e., Alice). Regardless of the existence of an intervening change in the law, Election Systems also argued that under Eleventh Circuit law issue preclusion would still not apply because two of the four required elements of issue preclusion were not met. More specifically, Election Systems argued that the § 101 issue was not actually litigated and it was not a critical and necessary part of the judgment in the first litigation.
The district court granted Election Systems’s motion to dismiss. The district court concluded that the Supreme Court’s decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 134 S.Ct. 2347 (2014), constituted a “substantial change” in the law such that the issue of patent validity was not precluded from consideration in the second litigation. As a result of that ruling, the district court did not reach an issue preclusion analysis under Eleventh Circuit law. The district court then proceeded to analyze the claims of the ‘449 patent under the Alice/Mayo § 101 framework, finding that the claims were directed to an abstract idea that did not contribute substantially more to transform the abstract idea into patent eligible subject matter. Accordingly, the district court held that all the claims of the ‘449 patent were directed to patent-ineligible subject matter and, therefore, invalid under § 101
Intervening Change in law
The Federal Circuit did not agree that Alice presented an intervening change in the law, rather surprisingly finding that Alice did not represent a shift or change in the law of patent eligibility.
“Turning to the first condition, we conclude that Alice, which was decided after the first litigation ended, did not alter the governing law of § 101,” Judge Lourie wrote. “In Alice, the Court applied the same two-step framework it created in Mayo in its § 101 analysis.”
“Moreover, to the extent that Election Systems argues that Mayo was an intervening change in the law, we disagree because Mayo was not intervening,” Judge Lourie went on. “Mayo was decided while the first appeal was still pending before this court.”
How the Federal Circuit could rule that Alice did not change the law governing § 101 is a bit of a mystery, at least to those familiar with the real world. Judge Lourie is no doubt correct when he says that Mayo set out the two-step framework, but if what he and the majority were suggesting is that the law of patent eligibility relative to computer implemented innovation was the same prior to Alice as it was after Alice then he and the rest of the panel are simply wrong. Alice most definitely changed the law.
Concluding that the same two-step framework was the test ever since Mayo seems a convenient way of dodging reality, and in fact creating a narrative that simply is not true. At a time when there is real momentum gathering for a legislative solution to § 101 why did the Federal Circuit choose to rule that Alice did nothing to change the law? Is the Court simply unaware of how such a statement, despite being clearly erroneous, will be misused in legislative debates? Alice most certainly changed the law of patent eligibility, in fact changing it to the point where the landscape bears absolutely no resemblence post-Alice to what it was pre-Alice.
Even the most casual industry observer has to know that Alice changed the law governing patent eligibility. Indeed, any attempt to say otherwise is nothing short of a most extraordinary revisionist history being foisted upon the patent community. Outcomes are unquestionably different as the result of Alice, and if outcomes are different how exactly is it possible that the law did not change? If the law remained the same why was Alice a clear pivotal moment in software patent history? Obviously something has significantly changed. It does no good, and in fact does real harm to the system to suggest Alice did nothing to change the law when everyone with even passing familiarity knows otherwise.
Mayo related to poorly written life sciences claims relating to a medical diagnostic. While the Supreme Court unnecessarily overruled itself and ignored the patent statute in reaching its decision in Mayo, the unquestionable reality is Mayo dealt with a technology different from the one present in Alice. Indeed, the last time the Supreme Court had dealt with computer implemented methods in Diamond v. Diehr, the Supreme Court had found the claims to be patent eligible. Moreover, one need only look at the wreckage of software patents both in district courts, at the PTAB and at the Federal Circuit since Alice, as well as the extraordinary loss in value of software patents post-Alice. 
Simply put, anyone who says Alice did not change the law is fooling only themselves. To what end the Federal Circuit seeks to fool themselves one can only wonder, but the Federal Circuit is wrong. Saying Alice did not change the law shows just how out of touch and insulated from reality the Federal Circuit has become.
Issue Preclusion & 101
Election Systems argued that by choosing not to respond to Voter Verified’s arguments against its § 101 invalidity counterclaim, the issue was never “actually litigated.” Moreover, Election Systems asserts that a determination of invalidity under § 101 was not critical or necessary to the ultimate judgment of noninfringement. The Federal Circuit agreed on both points. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that issue preclusion did not apply, not because there was a change in law, but rather because the issue of patent eligibility under § 101 was not actually litigated and it was not necessary to the judgment rendered.
Because issue preclusion did not apply, the Federal Circuit turned to the merits of the § 101 issue.
With respect to the first part of the Alice/Mayo test, Step 2A, the Federal Circuit explained that the claims are directed to an abstract idea. Judge Lourie wrote that the claims as a whole are to “the concept of voting, verifying the vote, and submitting the vote for tabulation. Humans have performed this fundamental activity that forms the basis of our democracy for hundreds of years.” Perhaps most damaging, however, was that Voter Verified themselves characterized these steps as “human cognitive actions” in their brief to the Federal Circuit.
With respect to Alice/Mayo Step 2B, which is sometimes referred to as the hunt for the inventive concept, the Federal Circuit found that there was no inventive concept in the claims sufficient to transform them into patent-eligible subject matter. “Neither party disputes that the claims recite the use of general purpose computers that carry out the abstract idea,” wrote Judge Lourie. “The case law has consistently held that these standard components are not sufficient to transform abstract claims into patent-eligible subject matter.”

The Next Supreme Court Justice: Here's What the Senate Should Ask About New Technologies and the Internet | Electronic Frontier Foundation,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/next-supreme-court-justice-heres-what-senate-should-ask-about-new-technologies-and,"Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination has sparked a great deal of discussion about his views on reproductive rights and executive authority. But the Supreme Court tackles a broad range of issues, including the present and future of digital rights and innovation. As Congress plays its crucial constitutional role in scrutinizing judicial nominees, Senators should take care to press the nominee for his views on how the law should address new technologies and the Internet.
We hope that the Court will ensure that constitutional protections extend to our digital landscape. To better understand whether Kavanaugh is likely to help or hinder, here are a few questions Senators should ask.
As an initial matter, any nominee to the Supreme Court must appreciate how the Court’s rulings may impact digital rights now and far into the future. In a 1979 case called Smith v. Maryland, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that people do not have a privacy interest in information they hand over to third parties (like the numbers you dial on a telephone). That case—where police had reasonable suspicion that a single individual was committing a specific crime—has shaped police practice in the digital age, and provided a contorted legal defense for mass domestic surveillance programs like the NSA’s call-records program, even though they subject millions of people to continuous monitoring based on no suspicion of any particular crime.
But the Court is starting to understand how much the Internet and the ubiquity of mobile devices have changed daily life in the United States. In Packingham, the Court acknowledged that social media has become the “modern public square,” and in Riley the Court ruled that law enforcement cannot search cell phones at the time of arrest because of the vast quantities of personal data they store. And just a few weeks ago, in Carpenter the Supreme Court ruled that the 4th Amendment applies to cell-phone-based location tracking—so if law enforcement wants historical customer location information from cell-phone providers, they will now have to get a warrant.
We hope this is a trend, and that the Court will do its part to ensure that constitutional protections extend to our digital landscape. To better predict whether Kavanaugh is likely to help or hinder, here are a few questions the Senate should ask him, keeping in mind that nominees traditionally steer clear of commenting on specific pending cases.
Mass Surveillance
In 2015, the D.C. Circuit refused to hear a case challenging the NSA mass telephone surveillance program. Kavanaugh issued a concurrence saying:
“The Government’s collection of telephony metadata from a third party such as a telecommunications service provider is not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment, at least under the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979)...”

And that even if the collection is a search, it is reasonable because:
“The Government’s program for bulk collection of telephony metadata serves a critically important special need – preventing terrorist attacks on the United States See The 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT (2004). In my view, that critical national security need outweighs the impact on privacy occasioned by this program.”

Given this broad assertion, the Senate should ask:
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence requires the government to have individualized suspicion before intruding against a person’s privacy. How would the Framers view mass data collection by the government—for example, copying or viewing all Internet activity routed through a service provider?
How should the Constitution address those who are impacted by, but not targeted by, surveillance?
Do you believe that the government can collect digital information from individuals without that collection constituting a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes?
Do people have a privacy interest in metadata that can be used to create a detailed timeline of someone’s actions?
Do bulk surveillance programs that create detailed pictures of the lives of millions of Americans, where they go, and who they associate with, implicate rights guaranteed under the First Amendment?
Are there any constitutional limits on the executive branch’s national security authority? What are they?
You have written that the government’s bulk collection program is a special need. What factual showing should the government make to use this doctrine? Is there a distinction between special needs exceptions for national security and law enforcement purposes?
Law Enforcement Access to Digital Information 
When US v. Jones was on appeal before the DC Circuit, Kavanaugh issued a dissent arguing that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in their “public movements,” but law enforcement nonetheless violated the 4th amendment by tampering with Jones’ car.
To better understand Kavanaugh's view on digital privacy, the Senate should ask:
Do you believe that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy when they move about in public?
Does tracking the location or other information about a subject over long periods of time implicate any further interests?
Is the reasonable expectation of privacy a “failed experiment?”
Do rights to privacy extend beyond a person’s property interests? Do you agree with the well-settled law long established in this area?
Do Terms of Service agreements and other contracts that caution users that their information may be shared with the police affect a person’s privacy interest?
Law enforcement is now using technologies like Automated License Plate Readers to track people as they move in their cars. Can the volume of data become a privacy harm, or a harm to First Amendment principles such as freedom of association, speech, and assembly?
With “smart cities” on the rise – cities that are beginning expansive government and third party data collection programs to offer more tailored services to the public – do constitutional safeguards against unreasonable searches extend to data the government has collected for a non-law enforcement purpose?
Net Neutrality 
In a dissenting opinion, Kavanaugh decried the DC Circuit's decision upholding the 2015 Open Internet Order -- and order, for which millions of Internet user fought long and hard, that forbade practice such as throttling, blocking, and pair prioritization-- saying that the Federal Communications Commission did not have clear authority from Congress to issue the 2015 Order. He also insisted that the rule infringed upon Internet service providers’ First Amendment rights. In fact, as EFF and ACLU explained in an amicus brief, while the ISPs do have First Amendment rights, the 2015 net neutrality rules appropriately balanced those rights against the public interest in a neutral Internet.
In light of this case and the multiple ongoing efforts to rescue  net neutrality after the FCC abdicated its role in protecting the Open Internet, the Senate should ask:
Can paid prioritization practices run afoul of consumer protection or civil rights laws?
How should the broadband Internet market be analyzed under current competition laws?
Does the Federal Communication Commission have the authority to determine the classification of broadband internet service providers?
Does the Communications Act occupy the field and preempt states and municipalities from passing their own laws blocking throttling, paid prioritization, and zero rating by broadband internet service providers?
How would the Constitution view Federal attempts to limit State broadband regulation?
Innovation 
Recent Supreme Court rulings have provided some balance to a patent system that many thought had gotten out of control. For example, in a 9-0 decision in Alice Corp v. CLS Bank the court invalidated an abstract software patent, essentially ruling that adding “on a computer” to an abstract idea does not make it patentable. The Court also ended rampant venue shopping that had led to more than 1,000 patent cases a year being filed in the courtroom of a single federal judge in East Texas. Thanks to decisions like these, many small businesses have been able to stave off unfounded legal threats.
Patent cases continue to appear on the Court’s docket, many of which will have consequences for software patents. To figure out Kavanaugh’s views, the Senate should ask:
Some people say that the U.S. patent office issues too many bad patents, allowing patent trolls to threaten operating companies trying to innovate, especially small start-ups. Others say the Supreme Court has gone too far in its recent cases that cut back patent protection on abstract ideas. What do you think are the purposes of our patent system?
Do you think that patent protection should extend to laws of nature or abstract ideas? Should small businesses have ways to protect themselves from unmeritorious patent claims, other than paying litigation cost-based settlements?
In addition, the long-running Oracle v. Google case may finally make its way to the Court, potentially giving the Justices a chance to opine on both the scope of copyright in software and the application of the fair use doctrine. The central question in the case is whether Oracle can claim a copyright on Java APIs and, if so, whether Google infringed these copyrights. Many, including EFF, argued that the APIs in question were not copyrightable in the first place. If the Court decides to review the case, its decision could affect software development for many years to come. Again, Kavanaugh won’t comment on pending cases, but the question of the scope of copyright is likely to come up one way or another. Given the impact of this area of law on digital innovation and expression, the Senators might ask:
What is the purpose of copyright generally? Do copyrights (and patents) exist primarily to reward their owners, or should their grant benefit the public generally?
Are there situations in which copyright may disserve innovation and expression? How should courts deal with such a situation?
Is fair use an affirmative right as opposed to a narrow defense?
Should companies that want to use a small portion of another’s copyrighted work be required to get a license, rather than rely on fair use? One of the judges for whom Kavanaugh clerked, Alex Kozinski, has publicly stated that a license should be required, rather than using an unlicensed work under circumstances that are fair use. Does Kavanaugh agree?
Can software be covered by both patent and copyright? Are there limits to this?
Competition 
Finally, many widely relied-upon Internet functions are now controlled by a few giant companies, and the dominance of these companies has proven to be sticky. It’s still easy and cheap to put up a website, build an app, or organize a group of people online—but a few large corporations dominate the key resources needed to do those things, and basic Internet access as well. That, in turn, gives those companies extraordinary power over speech, privacy, and innovation.
Against this background, policymakers are considering whether and how to recreate conditions for competition. Many are looking to antitrust law for a solution, but it’s not yet clear how antitrust law will apply to these circumstances. Meanwhile, the DOJ’s challenge to the AT&T-Time Warner merger is on appeal. If the DOJ or the FTC decides to take on the tech giants, and/or the appeal reaches the Supreme Court, its ruling could reshape competition law. The Senate might ask:
Does antitrust law authorize courts to remedy harms caused by the lack of competition in a given market, or is it limited to ensuring a narrow measure of consumer welfare? For instance, can regulators and courts scrutinize the acts of a monopolistic enterprise that lowers prices for consumers but also undermines competition?
Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court justices have been described as a “Kabuki” performance. With the next generation of American jurisprudence—and technology—hanging in the balance, we encourage Senators to thoughtfully and rigorously challenge the nominee to share his views.

_______________
The Federal Circuit in Alice
When the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided CLS Bank v. Alice Corporation, all the important questions that we thought might be answered remained completely and totally unanswered. There were only 10 judges who sat on the en banc tribunal and no more than 5 judges signed on to any one opinion.
The only thing we learned was this — the Federal Circuit issued an extraordinarily brief per curiam decision, which stated:
Upon consideration en banc, a majority of the court affirms the district court’s holding that the asserted method and computer-readable media claims are not directed to eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101. An equally divided court affirms the district court’s holding that the asserted system claims are not directed to eligible subject matter under that statute.
Thus, all of the asserted claims were deemed to be patent ineligible.
Let’s take a look at one particular representative asserted claim, Claim 33 of U.S. Patent No. 5,970,479:
A method of exchanging obligations as between parties, each party holding a credit record and a debit record with an exchange institution, the credit records and debit records for exchange of predetermined obligations, the method comprising the steps of:
(a) creating a shadow credit record and a shadow debit record for each stakeholder party to be held independently by a supervisory institution from the exchange institutions;
(b) obtaining from each exchange institution a start-of-day balance for each shadow credit record and shadow debit record;
(c) for every transaction resulting in an exchange obligation, the supervisory institution adjusting each respective party’s shadow credit record or shadow debit record, allowing only these transactions that do not result in the value of the shadow debit record being less than the value of the shadow credit record at any time, each said adjustment taking place in chronological order; and
(d) at the end-of-day, the supervisory institution instructing ones of the exchange institutions to exchange credits or debits to the credit record and debit record of the respective parties in accordance with the adjustments of the said permitted transactions, the credits and debits being irrevocable, time invariant obligations placed on the exchange institutions.
The 5 judge concurring opinion written by Judge Lourie found that there is “nothing in the asserted method claims represent significantly more than the underlying abstract idea for purposes of § 101.” Chief Judge Rader and Judge Moore agreed that the method and media claims are patent ineligible.  Therefore, there is a majority of thought (although not opinion) with respect to the above representative method and media claims. The other claims in the asserted patents are patent ineligible because that is what the district court held and there was a 5 to 5 split. Judges Linn, O’Malley and Newman would have found all of the asserted claims patent eligible.



But let’s look at several representative claims on which there is no Federal Circuit decision — starting with claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,725,375, which recites:
A data processing system to enable the exchange of an obligation between parties, the system comprising:
a first party device,
a data storage unit having stored therein
(a) information about a first account for a first party, independent from a second account maintained by a first exchange institution, and
(b) information about a third account for a second party, independent from a fourth account maintained by a second exchange institution;
and a computer, coupled to said data storage unit, that is configured to
(a) receive a transaction from said first party device;
(b) electronically adjust said first account and said third account in order to effect an exchange obligation arising from said transaction between said first party and said second party after ensuring that said first party and/or said second party have adequate value in said first account and/or said third account, respectively; and
(c) generate an instruction to said first exchange institution and/or said second exchange institution to adjust said second account and/or said fourth account in accordance with the adjustment of said first account and/or said third account, wherein said instruction being an irrevocable, time invariant obligation placed on said first exchange institution and/or said second exchange institution.
Here is claim 26 of the ‘375 patent:
A data processing system to enable the exchange of an obligation between parties, the system comprising:
a communications controller,
a first party device, coupled to said communications controller,
a data storage unit having stored therein
(a) information about a first account for a first party, independent from a second ac- count maintained by a first exchange institution, and
(b) information about a third account for a second party, independent from a fourth account maintained by a second exchange institution; and
a computer, coupled to said data storage unit and said communications controller, that is configured to
(a) receive a transaction from said first party device via said communications controller;
(b) electronically adjust said first account and said third account in order to effect an exchange obligation arising from said transaction between said first party and said second party after ensuring that said first party and/or said second party have adequate value in said first account and/or said third account, respectively; and
(c) generate an instruction to said first ex- change institution and/or said second ex- change institution to adjust said second account and/or said fourth account in accordance with the adjustment of said first account and/or said third account, wherein said instruction being an irrevocable, time invariant obligation placed on said first exchange institution and/or said second exchange institution.
Emphasis has been added to point out all of the specifically recited structure and tangible components, which unequivocally show that this claim is tethered to a machine. Notice how the computer is also recited as specifically configured.
Then Chief Judge Rader and Judge Moore would write: “Looking at these hardware and software elements, it is impossible to conclude that this claim is merely an abstract idea.” They are, of course, correct. Rader correctly pointed out in his dissent, which was joined by Judge Moore, that if all of the asserted patents in this case are invalid that will mean that hundreds of thousands of patents are now lost. He wrote:
[I]f all of these claims, including the system claims, are not patent-eligible, this case is the death of hundreds of thousands of patents, including all business method, financial system, and software patents as well as many computer implemented and telecommunications patents.
It is difficult to understand why it is fair to be judging these patents based on the disclosure standards and patent eligibility standards that have evolved over the past several years anyway. These patent applications were written 15 years ago or more when far less was required. Judging innovations based on a moving target is fundamentally unfair to start with, but coming up with a tie is unconscionable. If patents really are property changing rules would not be applied retroactively. People and corporations order their affairs based on the present understanding of the law and stripping property rights by applying a different legal standard 15 years later is not only fundamentally unfair but is hardly in keeping with legal norms associated with property rights. You would NEVER see this with respect to real property. Property rights need to be certain to maximize value and incentive.
Everyone would do well to seriously what Judge Newman wrote. She points out the obvious: “[T]he en banc court undertook to remedy distortions flowing from inconsistent precedent on section 101. This remedial effort has failed.”
Judge Newman also wrote:
Reliable application of legal principles underlies the economic incentive purpose of patent law, in turn implementing the benefits to the public of technology-based advances, and the benefits to the nation of industrial activity, employment, and economic growth. Today’s irresolution concerning section 101 affects not only this court and the trial courts, but also the PTO examiners and agency tribunals, and all who invent and invest in new technology. The uncertainty of administrative and judicial outcome and the high cost of resolution are a disincentive to both innovators and competitors.
 
SCOTUS in Alice
On Thursday, June 19, 2014, the United States Supreme Court issued its much anticipated decision in Alice v. CLS Bank. In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Thomas the Supreme Court held that because the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea, they are not eligible for a patent under Section 101.
The Supreme Court, using what they called the Mayo framework, which is ironic given how the Court so famously butchered U.S. patent law in the Mayo case, said that there are two considerations that must be taken into account. The first Mayo step is to determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts. The second Mayo step is to examine the elements of the claim to determine whether it contains an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea into a patent-eligible application.
The petitioner principally contended that the claims were patent eligible because these steps “require a substantial and meaningful role for the computer.” As stipulated, the claimed method requires the use of a computer to create electronic records, track multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous instructions; in other words, “[t]he computer is itself the intermediary.”
The Supreme Court explained that the relevant question was whether the claims do more than simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer. The Supreme Court said they did not.
The systems claims at issue in the case faired no better. The Supreme Court explained:
[T]he system claims are no different from the method claims in substance. The method claims recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to implement the same idea.
Truthfully, the Supreme Court decision in Alice can only be described as an intellectually bankrupt. The Supreme Court never once used the word “software” in its decision. The failure to mention software a single time is breathtaking given that the Supreme Court decision in Alice will render many hundreds of thousands of software patents completely useless. While the Supreme Court obviously didn’t want to make this decision about software, the holding does make it about software because each of the ways software has been traditionally claimed were ruled to result in patent ineligible claims.
Based on this decision it is hard to see how any software patent claims written in method form can survive challenge. This is extremely problematic because there are revolutionary software innovations covered by patents with substantial numbers of method claims. For example, some of the claims to IBM’s Watson computer, which is really akin to the first generation omnipotent Star Trek computer, seem to be quite clearly patent ineligible based on the Alice decision of the Supreme Court. It is impossible to see how the Watson claims structurally differ. See Is Watson still patent eligible? The only potential solace for IBM and others would be if the Federal Circuit narrowly interprets this decision noticing that the Supreme Court seemed almost preoccupied by the fact that the patent claims covered a financial process. As yet we have not seen that narrow interpretation from the Supreme Court, but the Federal Circuit has provided a ray of hope in DDR Holdings. 
Most troubling about the Alice decision is how the Supreme Court could issue a decision that doesn’t even use the word software, or recognize that software is patent eligible. Software is clearly patent eligible, at least if you concern yourself with the patent statute, which is supposed to govern on the matter. Software is mentioned throughout Title 35. It was specifically mentioned in the America Invents Act in 2011. For example, tax strategies are now deemed to be within the prior art and not patentable in and of themselves, but the AIA specifically says that software can still be patented even if it incorporates a tax strategy. [1] This is the type of analysis the Supreme Court engaged in the Bilski decision finding that business methods are patentable. So why did the Court not similarly recognize that at least some software must be patent eligible?
Ironically, at the end of the day, software patent claims written in typical, industry standard format will result in patent ineligible claims. Yet, at the same time, business methods are patentable. To call this bizarre and inconsistent doesn’t begin to scratch the surface.
In years to come this decision will no doubt be ridiculed for many legitimate reasons. In the meantime patent attorneys and clients will need to figure out how to proceed with pending patent applications and with applications that have not yet been filed.
TO BE CONTINUED… We will next look at how the USPTO has interpreted Alice v. CLS Bank and then ultimately conclude this series with a look at recent Federal Court cases interpreting Alice.

USAA Asserts Mobile Check Deposit Patents Against Wells Fargo - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/06/22/usaa-mobile-check-deposit-patents-wells-fargo/id=98511/,"
On June 7th, San Antonio, TX-based reciprocal inter-insurance exchange United Services Automobile Association (USAA) filed a lawsuit alleging claims of patent infringement against San Francisco, CA-based financial services multinational Wells Fargo. The complaint, filed in the Eastern District of Texas, involves the assertion of patents in the field of mobile financial services which, at first glance, appear as though they may face some rigorous validity challenges thanks to precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2014 decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International.
USAA is asserting a series of four patents-in-suit in this case, including:

U.S. Patent No. 8699779, titled Systems and Methods for Alignment of Check During Mobile Deposit. Issued in April 2014, it covers a system for depositing a check using a mobile device having a camera, a display and a processor configured to project an alignment guide in the mobile device’s display, monitor an image of a check within the camera’s field of view, determine whether the check image aligns with the alignment guide, automatically capture the image of the check when aligned with the guide and transmit the captured image of the check to a depository.
U.S. Patent No. 9336517, same title as the ‘779 patent. Issued in May 2016, it discloses a mobile device system wherein the alignment guide is associated with an information capture component to enable enhanced detection and extraction of information from a digital image of a check.
U.S. Patent No. 9818090, titled Systems and Methods for Image and Criterion Monitoring During Mobile Deposit. Issued last November, it claims a system comprising an image capture device, a presentation device and a processor configured to monitor a target document in the image capture device’s field of view with respect to a monitoring criterion, control the presentation device to present feedback information describing an instruction for satisfying the criterion, determine whether that criterion is satisfied and capture an image of the target document upon satisfaction of the criterion.
U.S. Patent No. 8977571, titled Systems and Methods for Image Monitoring of Check During Mobile Deposit. Issued in March 2015, it covers a non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising computer-readable instructions for depositing a check into a user’s bank account.

As USAA’s complaint notes, the ‘779 and ‘571 patents generally cover the use of an alignment guide to reduce error rates in mobile check depositing, and the ‘090 and ‘571 patents generally cover improved computer systems which are able to capture high quality check images. Such technology is critical to USAA, which serves members of the U.S. military and their families, because unlike traditional banks USAA reaches its customers remotely, not in brick-and-mortar bank facilities. USAA’s customers increasingly use the company’s website or mobile application to interact with the company’s services and the company developed these patents which cover the company’s Deposit@Home and Deposit@Mobile services.
USAA alleges that Wells Fargo Mobile Deposit remote deposit capture system, which was released years after either of USAA’s remote deposit services were first offered, infringes upon the asserted patents. Wells Fargo Mobile Deposit has been downloaded more than 10 million times from the Google Play Store alone and by February 2018, Wells Fargo had 21 million users who were actively using a mobile banking account. Wells Fargo mobile check deposit system involves the use of alignment guides and feedback indicators which are designed to assist customers in orienting the camera, features covered by the USAA patents. Although USAA approached Wells Fargo last August to discuss the licensing of USAA’s remote deposit capture patents, Wells Fargo allegedly continues to practice the technologies without any compensation to USAA. Along with counts for infringement of each patent asserted, USAA is also seeking a finding of willful infringement to enhance the actual damages by three times.
Considering the financial service that these patents cover, it’s not inconceivable that they might face challenges under the Supreme Court’s holding in Alice where it found that a computer system serving as a third-party intermediary for exchanging financial obligations was unpatentable as an abstract idea under 35 U.S.C. § 101. One could potentially argue that the patents only cover abstract ideas under Alice given that it covers the implementation of a traditional banking service (i.e.: check deposits) through a computer medium. Such issues in maintaining the validity of USAA’s patents are exacerbated by the prospects such patents could face at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), especially given the potential that these inventions could be deemed covered business methods (CBMs) subject to CBM review proceedings at the PTAB where Section 101 challenges are available to a patent-challenging petitioner.
A search of patent prosecution documents available through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Public PAIR website indicates that these patents didn’t faced many issues on Section 101 grounds during prosecution, even after the Supreme Court decided Alice. In February 2017, the patent application for USAA’s ‘090 patent received a non-final rejection from the examiner on double patenting grounds in light of another USAA patent, U.S. Patent No. 8422758, System and Methods of Check Re-Presentment Deterrent. The ‘090 patent would eventually be issued after USAA filed amended claims last June. The patent application leading to the issue of the ‘517 patent also received a non-final rejection in February 2015 on 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) grounds for anticipation and then a final rejection in July 2015 for double patenting, but these challenges were also overcome during prosecution of the patent at the USPTO. 
It will be interesting to see if any validity challenges under the Alice standard are brought by Wells Fargo to the district court.

Of course, if these patents are in fact deemed valid and enforceable in district court, it’s very possible that this suit against Wells Fargo could be just the start of a patent enforcement campaign against a series of banks offering mobile check deposit services. Wells Fargo is not the only major banking institution to offer mobile check deposit services via smartphone. Fidelity’s Mobile Check Deposit web page shows a smartphone taking an image of a check with the use of a rectangular feature on the phone’s display which seems to resemble the alignment guide covered by USAA’s patents. The same is true of mobile banking web pages found on the websites of PNC and Bank of America. So it appears that the result of USAA’s lawsuit against Wells Fargo will either result in USAA striking out big by losing its intellectual property, or USAA striking it rich in the incredibly valuable sector of mobile banking.

The Need for Legislative Reform: The Berkeley Section 101 Workshop | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/10/legislative-berkeley-workshop.html,"
Assessing the Need for Legislative Reform of Patent Eligibility in the Mayo/Alice Era: Final Report of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology Section 101 Workshop [Read the Full Report]
By Jeffrey A. Lefstin, Peter S. Menell, and David O. Taylor
Over the past five years, the Supreme Court has embarked upon a drastic and far-reaching experiment in patent eligibility standards. Since the founding era, the nation’s patent statutes have afforded patent protection to technological innovations and practical applications of scientific discoveries. However, the Supreme Court’s 2012 decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories imposed a new limitation on the scope of the patent system: that a useful application of a scientific discovery is ineligible for patent protection unless the inventor also claims an “inventive” application of the discovery. The following year, the Court ruled that discoveries of the location and sequence of DNA compositions that are useful in diagnosing diseases are ineligible for patent protection. And in its 2014 Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International decision, the Court ruled that software-related claims are ineligible for patent protection unless the abstract ideas or mathematical formulas disclosed are inventively applied.
These decisions sent shock waves through the research, technology, business, and patent communities. Medical diagnostics companies experienced a dramatic narrowing of eligibility for core scientific discoveries. Reactions within the information technology community have been mixed, with some applauding the tightening of patent eligibility standards on software claims and the opportunity to seek early dismissal of lawsuits, particularly those filed by non-practicing entities, and others criticizing the shift in patent eligibility. Several members of the Federal Circuit bluntly criticized the Supreme Court’s shift in patent eligibility standards on jurisprudential and policy grounds. Additionally, the Patent Office has struggled to apply the Supreme Court’s new and rapidly evolving standards.
As this sea change unfolded, many patent practitioners, scholars, PTO officials, and jurists hoped that the Supreme Court would provide fuller and clearer guidance on patent eligibility standards. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s rejection of the certiorari petition in Sequenom, Inc. v. Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc.—a case that many Federal Circuit jurists, scholars, and practitioners thought to be an ideal vehicle for clarifying patent eligibility standards, or for reexamining Mayo—we began planning a roundtable discussion among leading industry representatives, practitioners, scholars, policymakers, and retired jurists to explore the patent eligibility landscape and possible legislative solutions to the problems that have emerged.
We sought participants with significant knowledge and experience in the key industries affected by the shift in patent eligibility standards—principally the bioscience and software/information technology fields. To promote candid discussion among these participants, we established the following ground rules: (1) Participants would be free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) could be revealed; (2) We would prepare a report describing the results of the workshop—and that report would not attribute statements or views to individuals (other than the co-convenors); and (3) The report would list the participants and be made available to the public through BCLT.
Our Report summarizes the presentations and discussions exploring the legal background and effects bearing on legislative action. Part I contains a lightly edited version of the background document circulated to participants prior to the workshop. Part II summarizes the four workshop sessions leading up to the discussion of legislative proposals: (A) legal background; (B) effects on research and development (R&D); (C) effects on patent prosecution; and (D) effects on patent assertion, litigation, and case management. Part III summarizes the discussion of legislative proposals and sets forth a framework for seeking compromise on reform legislation.
As explicated in the Report, a consensus emerged that the current state of patent eligibility jurisprudence is indefensible as a matter of legal principle and is seriously undercutting incentives in sectors of the biotechnology industry. The workshop revealed broad agreement that the Supreme Court’s patent eligibility jurisprudence has diverged from the Patent Act’s text and legislative history, as well as long-standing jurisprudential standards. The participants also agreed that the Supreme Court’s ostensible rationale for its § 101 jurisprudence lacks a sound foundation, and that its formulation of the inventive application standard is grounded on a profound misapprehension of key historical precedents.
Furthermore, the workshop revealed a consensus that it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will reconsider the patent-eligibility issue in the foreseeable future. Conferees also doubted that the Federal Circuit will confront the core concerns surrounding patent eligibility. The USPTO has tended to be reactive only, or has adopted what some conferees viewed as unduly rigid interpretations of the case law.
Thus, legislative reform will be necessary to effect significant change in patent eligibility standards. Participants largely agreed that legislation would be necessary to address the problems that have emerged for bioscience researchers. Nonetheless, there was disagreement on the need for legislative reform of patentable subject matter relating to software and information technology. Moreover, there was a lack of agreement on the best solution to problems, and none of the current legislative proposals garnered consensus.
While nearly all of the conferees recognized that this state of the law poses serious concerns for bioscience research and development, there existed substantial reluctance on the part of some software industry representatives about pursuing legislative reform that could increase patent assertion activity and raise defense risks and costs in the software field. Some participants also thought that the courts should be given time to develop an appropriate screen for the eligibility of software patents and saw some progress in the developing case law.
This suggests to the workshop convenors and authors of the report (the three of us) that the most fruitful approach to reform legislation would restore the traditional patent eligibility standard at least for bioscience advances—that is, establishing that conventional applications of scientific discoveries are eligible for patent protection—while addressing concerns about cumulative creativity and abusive patent assertion. Such additional provisions could include the following: (1) an expanded experimental use exception at least for doctors and medical researchers; (2) exclusion of non-technological subject matter, notably pure business methods (a technological arts test); (3) a mechanism to encourage courts to consider 12(b)(6) motions directed to § 112 issues (as opposed to § 101 issues) early in patent case management; (4) fee-shifting aimed at discouraging nuisance value patent lawsuits; (5) higher thresholds for enhanced damages in the software field; and/or (6) shorter duration for algorithm-based inventions—i.e., where the point of non-obviousness is a computer-implemented algorithm. We further note that compromise legislation might also address distinctive issues relating to affected industries that lie outside of the patent field, such as reimbursement policies relating to medical diagnostics.

The CAFC Split Non-precedential Decision in Exergen v. Kaz Raises Interesting Issues About Eligibility Determinations - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/04/09/cafc-split-non-precedential-decision-exergen-kaz-eligibility/id=95542/,"
In Exergen Corporation v. Kaz USA, No. 16-2315 (March 8, 2018), the Federal Circuit, in a split non-precedential opinion, affirmed a holding that Exergen’s claims directed to methods and apparatuses for detecting core body temperature were directed to patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.  The Federal Circuit’s decision, like many of its recent § 101 decisions, raises many interesting issues, and we briefly address two of them.
Legal Background
Anyone who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof” may obtain a patent.  35 U.S.C. § 101.  However, because patents cannot monopolize the “building blocks of human ingenuity,” claims directed to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.  Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S.Ct. 2347, 2354 (2014).  In Mayo Collaborative Services. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012), and again in Alice, the Supreme Court provided a two-step framework for determining whether a claim is invalid under § 101.  In step one, courts determine whether the claims are directed toward a patent-ineligible concept.  If so, courts consider, in step two, whether the claims include additional elements that provide an “inventive concept” that transforms the claimed invention into a patent-eligible application.
Claiming well-understood, routine, or conventional activities will not make a claim “inventive” under step two.  For example, the claims at issue in Mayo, which were directed to optimizing the dose a drug by measuring its metabolite, were invalid because they did nothing more than “tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws” that determine an optimal dosage, and the claimed steps of measuring the metabolite and giving the drug were routine and conventional.  In Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc., 788 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2015), a method for isolating paternally inherited fetal DNA from maternal blood serum or plasma was invalid because the existence of such DNA in the serum or plasma was an unpatentable natural phenomenon, and the claims did nothing but apply conventional techniques to isolate that DNA.  Similarly, in Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health Diagnostics LLC, 859 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2017), the court invalidated a patent directed to a method of determining the risk of cardiovascular disease by measuring the quantity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the blood because the claims were directed to the natural phenomenon that MPO is correlated to cardiovascular risk, and applied “conventional MPO detection methods.”  In contrast, in Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981), the Supreme Court upheld claims directed to a process for molding rubber that involved using a computer to calculate the required cooling time based on a formula called the Arrhenius equation.  The Supreme Court later explained in Mayo that while the Arrhenius equation itself was not patentable, the claimed process was patentable “because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole.”
Exergen v. Kaz 
At issue in Exergen were claims directed to methods and apparatuses for detecting core body temperature by detecting the temperature of the forehead directly above the superficial temporal artery.  A temperature sensor is scanned across the side of the forehead while electronics in the detector search for the peak reading indicating the temporal artery.  The core body temperature is calculated from that peak temperature based on a mathematical formula.  According to the district court (No. 13-10628, D.Mass.), the parties, in post-trial briefing focused on whether Exergen’s claims, “when stripped of those elements that simply reflect law of nature, were ‘well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in …’ and whether singly or in combination, they truly illuminate an ‘inventive concept’” (quoting Mayo).  It went on, however, to state that “[t]he relevant laws of nature … do not drop out of the analysis altogether.”  The district court held that while the claims rely on natural laws—e.g., the formula calculating core body temperature based on temporal artery temperature—using the scanning technology in this context was sufficiently inventive and unconventional to make the claims patent-eligible.
The Federal Circuit affirmed, in a split decision.  The majority held that the district court did not clearly err in finding that it was unconventional to use temperature scanning technology to measure arterial temperature beneath the skin.  Though that technology was conventional in other contexts—for instance, detecting “hot spots” that could identify injuries—it was not conventionally used to measure core body temperature.  The fact that such use may have been disclosed in the art was not alone sufficient to make it conventional or routine.  The majority analogized this case to Diehr, explaining that the inventors had spent “years and millions of dollars” to determine the “coefficient representing the relationship between temporal-arterial temperature and core body temperature” and had “incorporated that discovery into an unconventional method of temperature measurement.”
Judge Hughes dissented, arguing that the majority erred by relying on the natural law in determining inventiveness at step two.  The district court had not disputed that the relevant scanning technology was conventional in other contexts, and had found only that it was not “routinely or conventionally used for the purpose of calculating core body temperature.”  Judge Hughes faulted the majority for finding inventiveness by combining conventional technology from another context with a natural law or phenomenon—he reasoned the majority’s reasoning conflicted with Ariosa, which invalidated patent claims relating to the use of conventional DNA isolation techniques in the new context of isolating certain fetal DNA.
Can Courts Consider The Natural Laws In Deciding Step 2? 
One of the more interesting issues raised by Exergen is whether claims can be “inventive” under step two by combining conventional technology from another context with a newly-discovered natural phenomenon (and, if so, when).  Judge Hughes is undoubtedly right that it cannot always be inventive to use conventional technology in a new context with a newly-discovered natural phenomenon.  Often the only reason the conventional technology had not been applied in that new context is because no one knew the natural phenomenon—in such a case, there is nothing inventive beyond the natural phenomenon itself.  For instance, in Ariosa it was not conventional to use DNA isolation to isolate fetal DNA from maternal blood serum, but only because people did not know such DNA was in the serum.
Judge Hughes seems to suggest that the correct step-two inquiry should be whether, assuming the natural phenomenon were known, it would have been conventional to combine that phenomenon with existing technology to practice the asserted claims.  He argues that consideration of whether the claims are really directed to the natural phenomenon or something more specific belongs at step one, and that step two is about whether the additional limitations are independently inventive.  But even aside from Exergen, the Federal Circuit arguably has not always followed that approach.  For instance in Rapid Litigation Management Ltd. v. CellzDirect, Inc., 827 F.3d 1042 (Fed. Cir. 2016), the court upheld claims directed to a process of repeating the conventional steps of freezing and thawing liver cells because a skilled artisan would not have known the cells would survive multiple freeze-thaw cycles (a natural phenomenon).  Though Judge Hughes characterized CellzDirect as a step-one case, the decision also held that the claims were inventive under step two.
What could be driving cases like CellzDirect and Exergen is the court’s sense that the additional claim limitations sufficiently narrow the claims to avoid monopolizing the natural phenomenon itself; courts seem to uphold claims when they incorporate natural laws into specific devices, but not when they simply tell a practitioner to apply a natural law.  But, as Judge Hughes argues, this inquiry seems more appropriate at step one, as it has little to do with the search for “inventiveness” in the additional claim limitations that is supposed to drive the step-two inquiry.
Given the uncertainty in this area, patentees with potential § 101 issues should emphasize both the novelty and specificity of all claim limitations that go beyond natural phenomena themselves.
Known Does Not Mean Well-Known
Another issue relates to the majority’s statement that “something is not well-understood, routine, and conventional [in step two of the Mayo test] merely because it is disclosed in a prior art reference.”  The Federal Circuit first drew this distinction (at least explicitly) just a month earlier in Berkheimer v. HP Inc., No. 2017-1437 (Feb. 8, 2018).  The Federal Circuit went further in Exergen by providing an example:  a thesis written in German, and located in a Germany university library, is prior art, but the thesis would not establish that something that is well-understood or conventional.
But is the distinction consistent with § 101 precedent?  To start, it is not inconsistent with the various Federal Circuit decisions that found patent claims invalid without considering whether the claimed methodology/techniques were routine, conventional, or well-understood.  It is also not inconsistent with Mayo and Ariosa.  In Mayo, for example, the Supreme Court found that the claimed measuring step was “routinely” performed by scientists, and in Ariosa, the Federal Circuit noted patentee admissions in the specification and prosecution history referring to certain claimed techniques as “standard,” “well-known,” and “routine.”  It is less clear whether the distinction was understood in Cleveland Clinic.  There, the Federal Circuit referred to the claimed methods as “conventional,” but that appears to be based on admissions in the specification that the methods were “standard” and “known in the art” and that kits were “commercially available.”  Under Exergen, would that be enough?  If not, is Exergen at odds with Cleveland Clinic?  Such questions may be addressed in the future, whether en banc, at the Supreme Court, or in future appeals of other § 101 determinations.
And what is the difference between a technique that is merely “known” (e.g., a technique disclosed in that German thesis) and a technique that is well-known and conventional?  Must that technique be cited ten or twenty times in the prior art?  To what extent does it have to be practiced or commercialized?  If a distinction must be made, determining whether a known technique is well-known may require very specific factfindings, as the majority in Exergen noted.  (Recently, the Federal Circuit was asked to consider en banc in Berkheimer whether factual issues are possible in the Section 101 analysis, and a petition for certiorari raising similar questions is pending in Cleveland Clinic.)  In view of Berkheimer and Exergen, patentees may be safe admitting that aspects of their claimed invention were known, as long as they explain why those aspects were nevertheless not conventional.  Still, the safer bet is for patentees to do what they can to distinguish their inventions from the prior art.

Stupid Patent of the Month: Upaid Sues “Offending Laundromats” For Using Prepaid Cards | Electronic Frontier Foundation,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/stupid-patent-month-upaid-sues-offending-laundromats-using-prepaid-cards,"When patent trolls threaten and sue small businesses, their actions draw the public’s attention to the worst abuses of the patent system. In 2013, a company called MPHJ Technology got called out in a U.S. Senate hearing as a “bottom feeder” engaged in “garden-variety extortion” after it sent out thousands of demand letters demanding payments from small businesses that dared to use printers with “scan-to-email” functions. Lawmakers, understandably, found it incomprehensible that broad, stupid patents were being used to sue burger stands and grocery stores.
It’s essentially a patent on having a prepaid account for—well, anything.
There’s a good reason for that concern. It’s hard to see how lawsuits against small businesses using basic technology do anything to “promote the progress of science and the useful arts.” By contrast, it is easy to see how these lawsuits harm companies and consumers by increasing the costs and risks of doing business.
But the intermittent public attention hasn’t stopped this most basic abuse of the patent system. Upaid Ltd., a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands, has been filing patent infringement lawsuits throughout 2018, including 14 against laundromats—yes, laundromats—from California to Massachusetts.
Upaid says that laundromats are infringing U.S. Patent No. 8,976,947. Claim 1 of the patent describes a computer system that performs “pre-authorized communication services and transactions,” after checking an account to see if a user “has a sufficient amount currently available for the … transaction.” It’s essentially a patent on having a prepaid account for—well, anything.
Right now, Upaid lawyers are focused on systems run by Card Concepts, Inc., a service provider that markets a system called Laundry Card to laundromats. Many of the Upaid’s complaints simply point to online photos of the laundromats and the relevant card dispensers as evidence of infringement.
This incredibly broad patent was granted in 2015, but dates to a series of applications stretching back to 1998. Even in 1998, a prepaid account was not an inventive concept. It’s a basic and longstanding idea, that isn’t improved by adding verbiage about a “plurality of external networks” and a “computer readable medium.”
And that’s exactly the argument that lawyers for Card Concepts Inc. made [.pdf] when they got sued by Upaid last year. CCI has rightly argued that the patent should be invalidated as abstract under the Alice decision. CCI’s motion may well succeed in defending their customers—at some point.
Meanwhile, though, Upaid has unleashed 14 lawsuits against laundromats in different states, and has promised more. Faced with the prospect of paying a lawyer, even if just to buy time, some of those small businesses are likely to pay unjustified licensing fees for this patent.
In fact, it has begun to happen. Last week, UPaid put out a press release boasting that a Houston-based facility called 24 Hour Laundry had agreed to pay them. Laundromats in Kansas, Massachusetts, and Monterey, California are next up on the list.
“When required, we will strenuously enforce our rights through litigation against offending laundromats,” warned Upaid CEO Simon Joyce. “Our recent settlement reveals that many parties are not aware that the card equipment critical to their successful laundry business infringes our patents.”
Upaid’s behavior is brazen, but it is not an anomaly. Other patent trolls have waged campaigns against small businesses that merely use off-the-shelf technology. For example, Innovatio IP Ventures sent thousands of letters targeting hotels and cafes that provide Wi-Fi for customers. In Upaid’s case, the company’s website doesn’t list any products or services, but states that it is engaged in “ongoing development” of “intellectual property related to mobile commerce systems.”
Lawsuits against small, non-technology business show how trolls exploit the patent system. The costs to challenge a wrongly granted patent are high—defending a patent lawsuit through a jury trial can cost millions of dollars. Faced with the possibility of that kind of “winning,” small businesses will often fold.
Yet this year, patent maximalists are actually talking about rolling back the key changes to patent law that give small businesses a fighting chance. The Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank decision has stopped hundreds of “do it on a computer” style patents in their tracks. Meanwhile, inter partes review, a process that can get wrongly issued patents thrown out at a lower cost, are also under attack.
Instead of considering patent bills that move in exactly the wrong direction, like last year’s STRONGER Patents Act, Congress should consider legislation focused on how to help the smallest businesses from being roped into unjustified and expensive patent disputes.

Startup Life Sciences Companies & Patent Eligibility,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/patent-eligibility-battle-life-sciences-companies-changing-landscape,"
Over the last few years, the United States Supreme Court has changed the landscape of patent eligibility with its decisions in Mayo Collaborative Servs v Prometheus Labs, Inc. 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012) and Alice Corp Pty Ltd v CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014).  While patent eligibility was not a primary focus in the life sciences area, the Supreme Court decisions and their progeny have sent shock waves through the life sciences field.  Numerous biotech and diagnostic patents have been found to be ineligible under the threshold patent statute.  This article addresses the changing landscape and key court decisions, suggests new avenues for companies to navigate the changed landscape and provides practical suggestions for companies in protecting and enforcing patents in the life sciences area.
United States Code 35. U.S.C. § 101 informs practitioners on what it takes for an invention to pass the threshold test of patentability. Considering all of the controversy that it invites, it may surprise some that patent eligibility is addressed in just one sentence: “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”  Interpretation of this section has changed significantly as the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) decide complex patent infringement issues involving patent eligibility. Patent eligibility, once deemed a gatekeeper in name only, has now become one of the most prominent defenses to patent infringement.
In many ways, life science patent disputes have formed the foundation of the current patent eligibility landscape. Cases like Mayo and Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2107 (2013) are nearly synonymous with the term “patent eligibility.”  In perhaps the first recent disruptive patentability case, the Supreme Court, in Mayo held that claims for methods of detecting a correlation between a metabolite, and the likelihood of a drug response, were not patentable. In invalidating the patent in question, the Court found that its claims did not recite anything “significantly more” than a natural law.  The following year, in Myriad the Court held that claims directed toward cDNA (synthesized DNA) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, were patent-eligible.  However, the Court held that the claims to an isolated nucleic acid that encodes BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, were not patent-eligible because they were directed to a natural product. The Myriad decision reversed Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 100 S. Ct. 2204 (1980) which had long held that isolated biological materials, which were otherwise not found in nature, were patentable.  
In view of these decisions, both courts and the United States Patent Office (USPTO) use a two pronged test that combines the logic in Mayo and Myriad:  (1) is the patent claim directed to a judicial exception and (2) is there any element or combination in the claims that amount to “significantly more” than the judicial exception.  
Post Mayo and Myriad, the Federal Circuit addressed the “significantly more” standard created in Mayo in Myriad Genetics et. al. v. Ambry Genetics Corp., 774 F.3d 755 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The Court evaluated Myriad’s nucleotide primers for amplifying BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and methods of comparing BRCA genotypes to diagnose breast cancer, and held that neither sets of claims were patent eligible. First, it found that since Myriad’s primers shared sequences, as well as a base-pairing function, with those of naturally occurring nucleic acids they were not patent-eligible. Second, applying the two-pronged Mayo test, it determined that the method claims were directed to an abstract idea of comparing and determining the existence of alterations, with the absence of “significantly more.”
Myriad Genetics gives patent attorneys direction when drafting and prosecuting patents and litigants guidance when assessing claims. Even if the invention appears to be directed to an abstract idea, there is a chance at patentability if a patentee can show something significant that the invention adds to the idea. These cases have also formed the foundation of the Supreme Court’s Alice v. CLS Bank International, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014) decision that is now also referenced to denote the two step patentability test used in almost every forum of patentability dispute.
Key Developments Post Mayo and Myriad   
Courts have applied the Mayo and Alice tests to determine patentability in countless disputes in the life sciences space. Each application of the test has given courts new opportunities to clarify the Mayo and Alice tests for different applications.
In Ariosa Diagnostics v. Sequenom, Inc., 788 F.3d 1371, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2015), the claims at issue were directed to a method of using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal plasma to diagnose fetal abnormalities. The method included amplifying a paternally inherited nucleic acid from the serum or plasma sample, and detecting the presence of a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin in the sample.
The Federal Circuit held that the patent failed the two step Mayo test.  First, the Court determined that the claims were directed to patent-ineligible subject matter, because the “method begins and ends with a natural phenomenon.”  Second, it held that the claimed method does not “transform” the naturally occurring phenomenon into a patent-eligible application. The Court emphasized that the process steps for encompassing a natural phenomenon must be “new and useful” to transform the phenomenon into one that’s patent eligible. The patentee’s petition for rehearing en banc, as well as a petition to the Supreme Court, were both denied.  
Nevertheless, in a rare bright spot, in Rapid Litigation Management Ltd. v. CellzDirect, Inc, 827 F.3d 1042 (Fed. Cir. 2016), the Federal Circuit overturned the District Court’s finding of patent ineligibility. The patents-in-suit related to a method of preserving hepatocytes.  The District Court, applying the Mayo test, found the patents directed to a law of nature, in that the cells were able to survive freeze-thaw cycles, and thus lacked an inventive concept. The Federal Circuit on the other hand held that the patent was not directed to a law of nature, but instead, a “new and useful laboratory technique.” Further, the Court found that, even if the patent was directed to a law of nature, it possessed an inventive concept. The Court proffered some guidance, stating that “patent-eligibility does not turn on ease of execution or obviousness of application.” Thus, while pre-emption is not the test for eligibility, a lack of pre-emption can show that a natural law is not being monopolized and can indicate the possibly of patentable subject matter.
In a further development, in June 2018, the USPTO issued new guidance that suggests that patents on methods of treating disease should usually be considered patent-eligible.  In its memo, the USPTO explained that examiners should apply the Federal Circuit’s ruling in Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Int’l Ltd., 87 F.3d 117 (Fed. Cir. 2018) which held that its schizophrenia drug Fanapt is eligible for patenting under the Mayo test.  In particular, the Court emphasized that method of treatment patents should be analyzed as a whole not just by looking at the parts dealing with natural phenomena.  This guidance provides much needed relief for the life sciences industry and indicates that when patents cover methods of treatment involving practical applications of natural relationships, they should be considered patent eligible.
A New Layer to the Landscape
A more recent case Steven E. Berkheimer v HP INC., FKA Hewlett-Packard Company, 881 F. 3d 1360 (2018) adds yet another layer to the evolving Mayo/Alice framework. In Berkheimer the Federal Circuit raised the evidentiary requirements for patent ineligibility petitioners. Using the Alice analysis, the Court stated: “[f]irst, we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to” a patent ineligible concept. If so, “we consider the elements of each claim both individually and ‘as an ordered combination’ to determine whether the additional elements ‘transform the nature of the claim’ into a patent eligible application.” Id. at 1365.
But, the Federal Circuit decided that “[t]he mere fact that something is disclosed in a piece of prior art, for example, does not mean it was well-understood, routine, and conventional.” Id. at 1369. It went on to say: “[t]he question of whether a claim element or combination of elements is well-understood, routine and conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant field is a question of fact. Any fact, such as this one, that is pertinent to the invalidity conclusion must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. at 1367. The Federal Circuit effectively raised the minimum requirement for patent invalidity.
It is no longer enough for a court, board, or examiner to conclude patent invalidity due to a plausible showing of “not significantly more.” The invalidator must see support for such an argument with clear and convincing evidence. This applies to both patent validity disputes, and patent prosecution. Indeed, the USPTO has instructed its patent examiners to provide evidence to substantiate their “not significantly more” arguments during the patent prosecution process. This may raise the acceptance rate for patents that otherwise would be rejected.
Using Alternative Forums
As the law and industry evolve, litigants are increasingly seeking resolution for their patentability disputes in new forums. Many disputes now take place in forums such as the PTAB and the ITC, which can offer streamlined processes that resolve faster than District Court litigation. Practitioners, particularly in the ever-evolving life sciences industry, should strategize to take advantage of the most appropriate forum given their differences and limitations.
The Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB)
While the PTAB is an increasingly popular forum, practitioners should keep in mind key  differences between the PTAB and the courts when planning patent infringement actions.  A case in point is Phigenix, Inc. v. ImmunoGen, Inc, 845 F.3d 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Phigenix initiated an Inter Partes Review (IPR) against ImmunoGen’s patent for an antibody maytansinoid conjugate before the PTAB and was ultimately unsuccessful. On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ImmunoGen filed a motion to dismiss based on Phigenix’s lack of standing which was granted.
While Phigenix’s original cause of action did not require a “case or controversy” and “injury in fact” because the PTAB is an Article I Tribunal, the Article III Federal Circuit where an appeal was sought does.  Phigenix informed the PTAB that it brought the IPR to bolster the value of its patent portfolio -- a “cause of action” that does not rise to the level of standing required for an Article III court leading to dismissal based on standing.  This case serves as a good reminder of forethought and procedural awareness in deciding between forums.
The International Trade Commission (ITC)
Although not as popular as the PTAB, the ITC is an increasingly utilized forum for life sciences patent disputes. This is possible because Section 337 of the Tariff act of 1930 specifies that:
“The importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation by the owner, importer, or consignee, of articles that… are covered by the claims of a valid and enforceable United States patent” is “unlawful.” 19 U.S.C. §1337
In light of this prohibition, patent owners often bring claims against importers of goods that may infringe on patented inventions. While Section 337 of the Tariff act of 1930 does not create a cause of that encompasses patent eligibility, as with many patent matters, the issue of patent infringement may turn on patent eligibility in an ITC Section 337 hearing.
One of the most notable such examples is Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Shaw’s analysis in the ITC investigation, Certain Portable Electronic Devices and Components Thereof, (337-TA-994).  ALJ Shaw evaluated whether the organizational methods, claimed in U.S. Patent No. 6,928,433, were patentable. Using the Mayo/Alice test, ALJ Shaw determined that the claim in question was “directed to the abstract idea of an organizational hierarchy,” and invalidated the patent. This shows that patent owners, engaging in any form of patent dispute must be aware of the implications of patent validity and also be aware of the forum’s ability to make a determination of patentability. It is possible to walk into an ITC investigation with a valid patent and leave without it.   
Looking Ahead
As the jurisprudence continues to evolve, practitioners can be confident that there will be many more changes in the patent eligibility battle. Life science patents have formed the foundation of the patent eligibility landscape and they continue to significantly impact the law and industry as they have over the past decade. As we look forward at the changing patentability landscape, it is likely that practitioners will see life science patents at the forefront of the changes to come.

6 Years Later: The Effects of the Mayo Decision on Diagnostic Methods - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/07/19/6-years-later-effects-mayo-decision-diagnostic-methods/id=99206/,"
2018 celebrates the six-year anniversary of one of the most important Supreme Court decisions of the modern era. On March 20, 2012, the Court handed down its ruling in Mayo v. Prometheus Laboratories. The decision was understood immediately to be a break from the immediate past, a product of the Court’s intention to clarify patent eligibility for a new era of biotech, pharma, and life science technologies. The Court hoped it would help clarify eligibility issues raised by new technologies that the drafters of Title 35 § 101, 102, and 103 hadn’t envisioned, but it’s done the opposite. Six years after the Mayo decision, eligibility is harder to discern than ever, especially for claims to diagnostic methods.
Section 101
The Mayo ruling was primarily concerned with Section 101 – the basic premise of U.S. patent law. It states: “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”
The Mayo decision
The plaintiff in the Mayo case was Prometheus Laboratories, a specialty pharmaceutical and diagnostics company that had patented a suite of tests for assessing the correct dosages of certain Crohn’s disease medications. When Mayo Clinic developed its own similar tests and began using them, Prometheus sued Mayo for infringement.
The Supreme Court ultimately invalidated Prometheus’ methods patent, saying, “The steps in the claimed processes (apart from the natural laws themselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional activity.” Importantly, the Court also added that “upholding the patents would risk disproportionately tying up the use of the underlying natural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further discoveries.”
A split framework
What’s most important about Mayo is that the ruling split the framework for determining patent eligibility into two parts:

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the long-held position that Section 101 has three categories of unstated exceptions: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. These exceptions are not patentable because they belong to everyone. The Court noted, by way of example, that this means Einstein could not have patented relativity, nor Newton any of his laws.
At the same time, the Supreme Court, also said that if an invention is based on an exception, it still might be patentable as long as it doesn’t restrict others’ use of that exception. The Court warned that judges should carefully examine such claims to avoid “interpreting patent statutes in ways that make patent eligibility “depend simply on the draftsman’s [the attorney’s] art.”

Directional change from 1981 to 2012
This two-step process represented a significant change, as it refuted a guiding principle established in the 1981 ruling for Diamond v. Diehr. According to the Diehr ruling: “In determining the eligibility of respondents’ claimed process for patent protection under § 101, their claims must be considered as a whole. It is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis.”
The Mayo ruling instead asked courts to “dissect” claims into the two-part framework outline above. This is an especially tricky proposition for assessing diagnostic method claims that often involve both laws of nature and genuinely inventive steps and procedures.
In the 6 years since Mayo, the life sciences have been hit hard, with the validity of method patents being frequently – and successfully – challenged. This trend can be attributed to Mayo, not least because its logic led to other similarly disruptive rulings.
Myriad Genetics
The Supreme Court returned to Section 101 in Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics in 2013, about a year after Mayo. This case allowed the Court to attempt to draw a Mayo-based separator between naturally-occurring discoveries and new applications of those discoveries. Here’s what happened:
Myriad Genetics had obtained a set of patents for isolating the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and identifying an important mutation that acted as a reliable predictor of women’s risk for breast cancer. Myriad then built diagnostic methods involving synthesized complementary DNA, or “cDNA.” When Myriad claimed others were infringing their patents if they used BRCA1 and BRCA2, a cohort of doctors, patients, and advocacy groups banded together to challenge Myriad’s patents.
At the District Court level, all of the BRCA 1 and 2 patents, including the cDNA, were invalidated as being naturally-occurring discoveries, citing Mayo. The Federal Court then went the other way, deciding all of the patents were valid since isolating a gene produces something not found in nature.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled the BRCA1 and BCRA2 genes to be unpatentable, since “Myriad did not create anything. To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention.” On the other hand, the cDNA that Myriad created from the genes was patentable because “the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made,” and thus, that “cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments.”
The Court took pains to note that this case wasn’t about a method claimed by Myriad, writing: “It is important to note what is not implicated by this decision. First, there are no method claims before this Court. Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method patent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA were well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad’s patents.”
Alice arrives
In 2014, just one year after the Myriad case was decided, the Supreme Court attempted to clarify Mayo once again in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. This time, it said that in determining patent eligibility, a court must:

Determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those three patent-ineligible concepts – e.g. laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.
Conduct a “search for an inventive concept” that ensures that “the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.’”

As a refinement of Mayo, this guidance isn’t especially profound, but unfortunately, the Court got more — and somehow simultaneously less — specific about the third exception: abstract ideas. It said that in order to not be considered an abstract idea, an invention had to offer “something more” – but the Court did not state what that might be, to the frustration of many. It’s an ambiguity that remains unresolved six years later.
Since Mayo, Myriad, and Alice
There are lots of examples of diagnostic-method patent holders caught in the wake of Mayo:

2014: Myriad Genetics went back to court and lost patents for BRCA diagnostic methods (ruled invalid) because they were based on the abstract idea of comparing a patient’s genes to baseline genes – a well-understood, routine and conventional method.
2015: A Federal Circuit panel invalidated Sequenom’s patent for prenatal gender tests based on fetal DNA screening – because DNA’s is considered natural phenomena and can’t be patented.
2016: Genetic Technologies sued Merial L.L.C for infringing its patent for a method of analyzing genomic DNA sequences. The district court invalidated Genetic Tech’s patent, asserting that is was “directed to a natural law.”
2017: Four patents owned by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation were invalidated because were found to be based on natural laws (methods of diagnosing the presence of myeloperoxidase as a signifier of cardiovascular disease).

Happy anniversary?
The Supreme Court’s efforts at redefining patent eligibility for the modern age and biotech really began in earnest back in 1980 with the controversial bacteria of Diamond v. Chakrabarty. The Court’s ongoing struggles show the inadequacy of our patent laws when it comes to biotech especially, and technology in general. The Court is essentially attempting to build the car while they’re driving it, and that’s bound to result in a bumpy ride.
In addition, it could be argued that discarding Diehr’s admonition to consider each patent as a whole rather than its constituent parts was a mistake – placing current courts in the position of dissecting complicated patent claims beyond their capabilities.
For now, we can only hope new cases emerge that result in sufficient clarity to tip the balance back from excessive patent denials and invalidations and more effectively protect the innovations so regularly emanating from the biotech, pharma, and life science industries.

Phonetic Symbol System Not Patent Eligible | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2018/07/phonetic-symbol-eligible.html,"
In re Wang (Fed. Cir. 2018) (nonprecedential)
In a non-precedential decision, the Federal Circuit has rejected George Wang’s pro se appeal — affirming the PTAB judgment that Wang’s claimed phonetic symbol system lacks eligibility under Section 101.
The baseline here is that the written english language is only quasi-phonetic.  Every rule of spelling or pronunciation has layers of exceptions.  Linguists have developed a phonetic pronunciation guides, but those use quirky non-english letters.  Wang’s invention here offers a one-to-one system tying each vowel and consonant sound to a single phonetic symbol, and uses only English letters for the phonetic symbols. Table 1 below comes from Wang’s patent application and offers an example embodiment of his system:

The claim (slightly edited for clarity):
A phonetic symbol system comprising:
a plurality of phonetic symbols,
wherein each of said phonetic symbols is defined by one (or more than one) letter of English alphabet, the case or the style of said letter does not affect the sounds of said phonetic symbols,
[said phonetic symbols include] vowel phonetic symbols and consonant phonetic symbols . . . ,
each vowel [sound] is distinctively represented by one of said vowel phonetic symbols, and each consonant [sound] is distinctively represented by one of said consonant phonetic symbols.
Rather than reaching the more controversial aspects of eligibility, the court here first focused on the statutory requirement that a patent must be directed to a “process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.” 35 U.S.C. 101.  Since the claim is not directed to any concrete physical form, it cannot be a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.  Further, because the claim does not actually require performance of any steps, then it cannot be defined as a process.
Without analysis, the court also agreed with the PTO that “defining phonetic symbols in language, using strings of English letters, is an unpatentable abstract idea” and  that the claims offer nothing beyond the abstract idea:
[W]here, as here, claims of a patent application recite an abstract idea, the question becomes whether they contain “additional features” that embody an “inventive concept,” so as to nevertheless make them patenteligible. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct.
2347 (2014). The application claims on appeal, however, contain no “additional features” of any kind embodying an inventive concept. The claims merely encompass strings of English letters representing sounds. In short, there is no inventive concept that rescues them from patent ineligibility.
Rejection affirmed.
As the old saying goes, part of Mr. Wang’s problem is that he “has a fool for a client.”  Patent law and procedure is at such a high level of complexity that it very rarely makes sense for an inventor to represent himself — especially at the appellate level.
My question for the patent attorneys and agents here: Is there a way for Wang to turn this case around by amending the claims so that they recite a particular method.  [Read the application here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130054227]  Is this the type of idea that patent law should cover?  Consider U.S. Patent No. 7,004,758.

Federal Circuit says Claims for Summarizing Information are Not Abstract,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/02/02/claims-summarizing-information-not-abstract/id=93240/,"
Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. v. LG Elecs., Inc., Nos. 2016-2684, 2017-1922, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 1931 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 25, 2018) (Before Moore, O’Malley, and Wallach, J.) (Opinion for the court, Moore, J.) (Concurring in part and dissenting in part, Wallach, J.).
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of LG‘s motion for summary judgment that various claims of Core’s patents were directed to patent ineligible subject matter under Section 101. The Court also affirmed the district court’s denial of LG’s motions for judgment as a matter of law that the claims were anticipated and not infringed.
Core’s patents related to display interfaces for electronic devices with small screens, which allow a user to access data more quickly. LG characterized the claimed invention as “displaying an application summary window while the application is in an unlaunched state.” LG moved for summary judgment that the claims are “abstract” and invalid under Section 101. The district court denied the motion. The claims are not abstract, because the “application,” “summary window,” and “unlaunched state” are applied to specific devices, like cell phones. At trial, the jury found all of Core’s claims infringed and not invalid. LG moved for judgment as a matter of law on both issues, which the district court denied.
On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of summary judgment based on invalidity. Under Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2354 (2014), if the claims at issue are directed to a “patent ineligible concept,” then the court will “examine the elements of the claim to determine whether it contains an ‘inventive concept’ sufficient to ‘transform’ the claimed abstract idea into a patent-eligible application.” If the claims are directed to a patent-eligible concept, they satisfy Section 101. Here, the Court looked to whether the claims were directed to a specific improvement in the capabilities of computing devices, or, instead, “a process that qualifie[d] as an ‘abstract idea’ for which computers are invoked merely as a tool.” Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016).
Core’s claims were directed to an improved user interface for computing devices, which was not an abstract idea. While the generic idea of summarizing information was known, the claims were directed to a “particular manner of summarizing and presenting information in electronic devices” that improved the efficiency of the electronic device over the prior art. Therefore, the claims were not directed to an abstract idea.
The prior art taught a display for mobile phones that “provide[d] an arrangement for dynamically varying how space on a small display is allocated ….” LG moved for judgment by arguing that the reference taught every element of the claims at issue and that Core failed to rebut LG’s prima facie case of anticipation. The Federal Circuit disagreed, noting that Core’s cross-examination of LG’s expert give the jury reasons why the expert might be incorrect. The jury was not required to give full credit to LG’s expert, nor did the evidence favor LG so strongly that judgment as a matter of law was warranted.
Regarding infringement, the district court construed “unlaunched state” to mean “not displayed” by the interface. Under this claim construction, the jury found that LG infringed the patent. On appeal, LG argued that the correct construction should be “not running,” but the Federal Circuit affirmed the claim construction and found substantial evidence to support the jury’s verdict.
Judge Wallach’s Separate Opinion

Judge Wallach filed an opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part. He agreed with the majority that the district court did not err in determining the claims at issue were patent eligible. However, he agreed with LG that “unlaunched state” means “not running” instead of “not displayed.” He would have remanded for a review of infringement based on this claim construction.
Conclusion
The concept of summarizing information can be patent eligible (not abstract) when specifically applied to improving the efficiency of the electronic device, as in a “particular manner of summarizing and presenting information in electronic devices.”

The immense growth of information technology over the past few decades has necessitated the development of various tools which work to protect critical information from falling into unauthorized hands. A cybersecurity market report released this March by Zion Market Research predicts the global market for cybersecurity products and solutions will increase by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5 percent between 2016 and 2021. Between 2015 and 2021, global revenues for this market are expected to rise from $105.45 billion up to $181.77 billion.
One firm working to get itself well-situated to capture a valuable sector of this market is U.S.tech firm SafeBreach, which recently announced the issuance of three U.S. patents in the field of breach and attack simulation. This news follows weeks after SafeBreach closed a $15 million series B round of funding involving backing from major payment solutions firm PayPal. SafeBreach patents include:

U.S. Patent No. 9892260, titled System and Method for Creating and Executing Breach Scenarios Utilizing Virtualized Elements. It discloses a computing system for analyzing potential breach points utilizing instructions executed by a processor to parse a breach scenario file. This patent covers the format, process and user experience for designing, mapping and applying breach and attack scenarios to specific environments.
U.S. Patent No. 9710653, titled System and Method for Verifying Malicious Actions by Utilizing Virtualized Elements. It claims a networked system of hardware components configured with computer program code for verifying breach vulnerabilities within the networked system through parsing, targeting and coordination of breach scenario elements to avoid false positives in breach testing.
U.S. Patent No. 9473522, titled System and Method for Securing a Computer System Against Malicious Actions by Utilizing Virtualized Elements. It covers a system for protecting a target computer system which includes methods of simulating malicious activity, determining whether that malicious activity was successful and providing remediation feedback based on breach simulation results.

According to the company’s recent news release, SafeBreach is the first company operating within the breach and attack simulation market to be awarded patents covering its technologies. According to Itzik Kotler, SafeBreach co-founder and CTO and the lead inventor listed on the SafeBreach patents, this particular sector is very valuable given the need that most companies have to remain proactive in defending against malware and other cyber threats. “Today, the person in charge of information security for a company knows that they need to stay ahead of threats and adversaries; the challenge is the list of adversaries is growing,” Kotler said. “Companies can now be targeted by nation-states like North Korea, cybercriminals operating in China or Russia or simply a curious teenager that downloads a hacking tool. The SafeBreach philosophy is, in order to defend your capital, you need to know how it can be attacked in the first place. Our software executes thousands of attack scenarios to reveal problems ahead of time, and advises you how to fix them, typically by optimizing the security tools and investment that are already in place.”  
According to Kotler, SafeBreach’s major customer base consists of companies which are actively investing in security technologies and have already bought security control and not so much smaller companies which don’t have firewalls or other basic security measures in place. “The question we’re trying to help customers answer is how to improve their return on investment,” Kotler said. “How can they increase that return through their existing spend or what can they change in their security operations center to help them better detect threats in their information technology system.”
Kotler acknowledges that SafeBreach has competitors but he notes that the company is offering a major advance in automating work which has typically been performed by human consultants. “Our competitive advantage is in the fact that you can buy our software once instead of having to hire a consultant multiple times,” said Kotler, who himself used to work as a security consultant. “The problem with using consultants to validate security is that they can only provide a point-in-time approach, with a constrained set of test requirements. For example, a company would pay me to come in and tell me their specifications, then we’d agree on the rules of engagement. Once my pen-testing project was complete, the findings were only valid until any changes were made. After those changes, there would be additional charges for new tests. I was engaged in that process for years, and realized the need for a consistent, automated way to actually validate security, not just once per quarter, but on a continuous basis. That was the genesis for developing this technology.”
Aside from the technologies patented by SafeBreach, the company also offers their Hacker’s Playbook™ which Kotler considers to be part of the SafeBreach intellectual property portfolio. “We provide content to customers on a weekly basis to simulate hacker techniques and narrow down to a binary ‘yes’ or ‘no’ whether a hacker can do A, B or C,” Kotler said. “We also augment this playbook with top attacks in the headlines like WannaCry, Meltdown, and US-CERT Alerts to enable our customers to proactively address security issues.”
Of course, given that SafeBreach software technology automates work previously performed by human consultants, there would seem to be some question of the validity of the company’s patents in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, a decision which has greatly hindered the patent-eligibility of software inventions. Seth Ostrow, patent counsel for SafeBreach and chair of the patent group at Meister Seelig & Fein, offered the following statement on the patent-eligibility of SafeBreach’s technologies:
“SafeBreach has little concern about the impacts of the Alice standard on its patents.  SafeBreach’s patents were filed and prosecuted through the U.S. Patent Office after the Supreme Court’s 2014 Alice decision.  The new patentability subject matter standards which resulted from that decision were thus considered by the Patent Office as part of its rigorous examination process.  In one instance, the examiner raised concerns under Alice and those were resolved through claim amendments and explanations.  Ultimately, SafeBreach’s patents cover its groundbreaking technical solutions on system security which improve the workings of the system and thus clearly qualify as patentable subject matter under the new Alice standards.”

Clicker Heroes maker compares new lawsuit from “patent troll” to extortion | Ars Technica,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/clicker-heroes-maker-compares-new-lawsuit-from-patent-troll-to-extortion/,"


Enlarge / This is a screen grab from the forthcoming Clicker Heroes 2. 
Playsaurus, a small Los Angeles-based game studio that makes Clicker Heroes and the upcoming Clicker Heroes 2, has recently been threatened with a lawsuit if it doesn’t pay $35,000 for a patent licensing fee to cover a patent for “electronic tokens.”
In a Thursday blog post, the CEO of Playsaurus wrote that the company that sent him the letter, GTX Corporation, is a “patent troll.” CEO Thomas Wolfley called GTX’s demands to avoid “costly litigation” over Playsaurus’ use of electronic “Rubies” in its games “meritless.”
In a brief phone interview with Ars on Friday, Wolfley told Ars that receiving the demand letter was disconcerting.
“I kind of feel like it’s as if someone walked into my home with a knife and asked me for $35,000, except it’s legal,” he said. “I’ve been stressed out this whole week.”
Leslie Jacobs, the Maryland-based attorney who sent Playsaurus the demand letter, did not respond to Ars’ request for comment.
GTX claims that its patent (7,177,838, or simply ‘838) seemingly covers any kind of digital credit or currency. The patent was filed in 2000—it notes that “Electronic commerce using the World Wide Web (Web) is exploding in growth”—and was issued in 2007.
On its website, GTX describes itself as a company “dedicated to the development of technologically advanced proprietary raster-to-vector conversion and editing software to bridge paper to CAD.” The website makes no mention of “electronic tokens” or the ‘838 patent.
However, the ‘838 patent was fairly quickly used as a weapon in litigation. A company called Actus used ‘838 as early as 2009 in a lawsuit against Apple, Amazon, eBay, and others. That lawsuit was ultimately settled.
More recently, GTX has also filed suits over alleged infringement of the ‘838 patent against a Cypriot game company and another British company called Soccer Manager Limited. The precise relationship between GTX, Actus, and another company, PayByClick, is unclear. The ‘838’s patent history shows that the assignee has bounced between those three entities.
The inventor of the ‘838 patent is listed as one Marvin Ling, who is Andrew Ling’s father—Andrew now serves as the company’s CEO. Andrew, who also did not respond to Ars’ request for comment, is also the co-founder of PayByClick.
In the blog post, Wolfley continued that GTX’s legal efforts were “abusive and unethical,” noting that $35,000 was half the annual salary of an employee. He also wrote:
As I am a major owner of Playsaurus, I see this as a personal attack, and the cost in my own time and well-being has already been significant and draining. It is a shame that the United States legal system can’t provide a quick and easy way for us to punish them for these actions.
I believe it is unethical on our part to pay any negotiated amount, which serves to encourage the behavior of trolls with bogus claims. So, if pressed, we will take the matter to court and see it to the end. We have retained a law firm to assist and represent us if necessary. Playsaurus is a 100-percent privately owned organization, and we are not beholden to outside investors. We absolutely refuse to negotiate license fees with patent holders who make bogus claims.
Wolfley’s attorney, Miguel Bombach of Perkins Coie, a major commercial law firm, wrote back in a sternly-worded letter that Jacobs’ allegations were “baseless.”
Primarily, he argued, the ‘838 should be invalidated as it is an unpatentable abstract idea, which was resoundingly rejected in a unanimous 2014 Supreme Court decision known as Alice Corp v. CLS Bank.
Bombach continued:
This abstract idea is no different than using tickets to purchase drinks at a party or going to an arcade and using tokens to play games... Applying the idea with a “server” or reciting “memory” does not transform this concept into something that is patent eligible. After Alice, buying and using tokens for transactions (like a kid would do at Chuck E. Cheese’s), cannot be patented by simply reciting computers and the Internet. Furthermore, GTX’s attempted preemption of using tokens on the Internet clearly signals patent ineligible subject matter under Alice.
GTX has not yet responded to Bombach’s letter.

"Surviving Alice: Sufficient Inventive Concept Must be in Claim, Not Specification - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law",http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/11/10/surviving-alice-sufficient-inventive-concept-claim/id=90109/,"
Two-Way Media Ltd v. Comcast Cable Communs., LLC, Nos. 2016-2531, 2016-2532, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 21706 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 1, 2017) (Before Lourie, Reyna, and Hughes, J.) (Opinion for the court, Reyna, J.).
The Federal Circuit affirmed a district court decision finding four patents owned by Two-Way Media (“Two-Way”) were directed to ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Claim 1 of the ‘187 patent was representative of the ‘187 and ‘005 patents, and described a method for transmitting message packets over a communications network, like the Internet. Claim 29 was representative of the ‘622 patent, and described a method for forwarding real time information to one or more users having access to a communications network. Claim 30 was representative of the ‘686 patent, and recited a method for metering real-time streaming media for commercial purposes.
The Alice Two-Part Test for Patent Eligibility
The court evaluated Two-Way’s patent claims under the Alice two-part test for patent eligibility. See Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). Step one of the Alice test considers whether the representative claims, when considered in their entirety, are “directed to” a judicial exception to patent eligibility under § 101. These are laws of nature, natural phenomenona, and abstract ideas. “[T]he court considers whether the claims in the patent focus on a specific means or method, or are instead directed to a result or effect that itself is the [judicial exception] and merely invokes generic processes and machinery.” McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2016). If the claims are directed to a judicial exception, the court moves to step two and considers whether the claims contain an “inventive concept sufficient to transform the nature of the claim[s] into a patent-eligible application.”
The District Court’s Findings
With respect to the ‘187 and ‘005 patents, the district court determined representative Claim 1 was directed to the abstract idea of (1) sending information, (2) directing the sent information, (3) monitoring receipt of the sent information, and (4) accumulating records about receipt of the sent information. Two-Way argued that the ‘187 and ‘005 patent claims contained an inventive concept because they were related to “computer architecture.” However, the district court cited the claim constructions (which it adopted from Two-Way) and found that the claims did not recite a “saving inventive concept” under Alice step two because they did not “recite or refer to anything that could be described as architecture.”
Regarding the ‘622 and ‘686 patents, the district court found the ‘622 patent to be directed to the abstract idea of monitoring the delivery of real-time information to a user, and the ‘686 patent to be directed to the abstract idea of measuring the delivery of real-time information for commercial purposes. Under Alice step two, both patents had no saving inventive concept because “although [the claims] recited some computer components, they required only ordinary functionality of these components.” Claims directed to generalized steps and utilizing conventional computer activities are not patent eligible under § 101. See Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc., 790 F.3d 1343, 1348-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
The ‘187 and ‘005 Patents
The Federal Circuit agreed with the district court’s step one Alice analysis, finding that representative Claim 1 recited a “method for routing information using result-based functional language.” The claim was directed to an abstract idea because it failed to indicate “how the claim[] [was] directed to a scalable network architecture that itself lead[] to an improvement in the functioning of the system.”
The Court then proceeded to Alice step two. While the specification may have described a possible innovative “scalable architecture” concept, representative Claim 1 of the ’187 patent did not. This lack of inventive concept in the claim itself could not be overcome and thereby precluded eligibility. Further, the Court found that Claim 1 did not require anything other than a conventional order of steps to be carried out on conventional computer and network components operating according to their ordinary functions. Therefore, there was no inventive concept present to transform the patents into an eligible application under § 101.
The ‘622 and ‘686 Patents
The Federal Circuit agreed with the district court and found the ‘622 and ‘686 were directed to abstract concepts. Moving to Alice step two, the claims did not contain an inventive concept sufficient to transform them into something patent eligible. The Court once again found that no inventive concept relating to “system architecture” resided in the claims. Additionally, the claims were directed to conventionally ordered steps and utilized conventional computer activities. Therefore, there was no inventive concept in either the ‘622 or ‘686 patent, and the patents were ineligible under § 101.
Take-Away Teaching
For claims directed to judicial exceptions under § 101, a patent cannot identify a sufficient inventive concept solely in the specification and survive the Alice inquiry; the inventive concept must be found in the claims themselves in order to transform the nature of the claims into a patent-eligible application.

                U.S. top court wary of major change to software patent law | Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ip/u-s-top-court-wary-of-major-change-to-software-patent-law-idUSBREA2U05X20140331,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices stepped gingerly into a raging debate over computer software on Monday, voicing concerns about vaguely defined patents but signaling they would avoid any radical change to existing law. People walk in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, March 24, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstThis may help tech companies fend off lawsuits filed by “patent trolls,” defined as companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products, but not as much as a broad ruling would. For companies holding many patents, such as IBM Corp, a narrow ruling from the court would be better than a broader decision that tightened patent eligibility. From their questions during an hour-long oral argument, the justices appeared likely to rule, as expected, that patents held by Australian company Alice Corp Pty Ltd for a computer system that facilitates financial transactions were not patent eligible. CLS Bank International, which uses similar technology, challenged the patents in 2007. Although some of the nine justices signaled a willingness to go further and provide new guidance to lower courts that would describe exactly what types of computer-implemented inventions were patent eligible, others suggested there was no need for so broad a ruling. A ruling is expected by the end of June. If the court were to avoid any major pronouncements, the outcome could mirror a 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos, in which the court was expected to offer guidance on business method patents but eventually issued a relatively narrow 9-0 decision. COMPANIES WATCHING CLOSELY Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether a proposed test, suggested by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli on behalf of President Barack Obama’s administration, would make the complex issue any clearer. “I’m just doubtful that’s going to bring about greater clarity and certainty,” Roberts said of the proposal. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also suggested the court might steer clear of the broader question. “Why do we have to ... reach software patents at all in this case?” she asked Verrilli. The case is being closely watched by a broad swath of companies in the technology sector and beyond. Google Inc, Dell Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Microsoft Corp, and Hewlett-Packard Co were among a large list of companies that filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of CLS. A smaller number, including engine manufacturer Cummins Inc, supported Alice, while others, like IBM, supported neither side. Companies vary over what kind of eligibility threshold they would prefer. Those that often get sued for patent infringement, such as Google, favor a tighter definition. Those that want to protect their many patents, such as IBM, would prefer that most software be patent eligible. LOWER COURT SPLIT In May 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., ruled for CLS but the judges were split 5-5 on which legal test to adopt. On the patents contested in the case, several justices, including Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, suggested they appeared to be too abstract to be eligible for patents. Previous Supreme Court rulings have said abstract ideas are generally not eligible for patents unless the inventor shows a way of applying the idea. Making references to ancient Greek inventor Archimedes and other historical figures, Justice Stephen Breyer was one of the court members who appeared keen on a ruling that would have broad application. On the one hand, he noted, patent eligibility that is too broad creates monopolies and reduces competition down to “who has the best patent lawyer.” On the other hand, if patent eligibility is too strict, it could “rule out real inventions with computers,” he added.

"Patent-Ineligibility of Medical Diagnostics, Life Sciences Discoveries Arrests U.S. Progress - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law",https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/01/07/patent-ineligibility-medical-diagnostics-life-sciences-discoveries/id=90805/,"
In late November, a few announcements issued by academic research centers in Europe indicated that some impressive advancements in the medical and life sciences were unfolding, each of which could prove to have major industry impacts. On November 20th, there were reports that Austrian oncologist Thomas Bauernhofer of the University Hospital Graz had successfully identified a protein which indicates a higher risk of mortality in breast cancer patients. In a research project funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), evidence emerged that a higher expression of the GIRK1 protein in malignant tissue samples was linked to higher relapse and mortality rates in breast cancer patients who have gone through surgery. The novel use of the GIRK1 protein as a biomarker could have a great impact on breast cancer diagnostics and treatments and further research could yield more discovery on the interdependence of GIRK1 with other important biological pathways critical to cancer management.
About a week later, on November 29th, news came out that another Austrian research team had made successful strides in a genetic technology for the degradation of hydrocarbons. Researchers at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU) discovered the genetic pathway through which the fungus Cladophialophora immunda degrades toluene, an environmentally harmful hydrocarbon. A series of eight genes transferred to C. immunda fungi from bacteria demonstrated the degradation of toluene while signs of stress within the fungus, including the production of antioxidants and the activation of cell detoxification mechanisms, indicates that the fungus actively works to destroy any toluene it contacts.
Unfortunately, thanks to recent case law interpretations from the U.S. Supreme Court, it would appear that neither of these important scientific advances could led to the development of any patentable subject matter. The discovery of GIRK1 as a biomarker for breast cancer diagnostics would run into 35 U.S.C. § 101, the basic threshold statute for determining patentability of subject matter, under the Supreme Court’s March 2012 ruling in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. In that case, the Court held that processes involving correlations between blood test results and patient health is not patent-eligible subject matter because the process incorporates laws of nature. This would seemingly render any processes involving the application of GIRK1 as a biomarker for breast cancer prognoses unpatentable as well as the expression of GIRK1 occurs naturally.
Similarly, a patent covering the use of the genetic sequence of the C. immunda fungus to degrade toluene is likely unable to be upheld on Section 101 invalidity grounds based on the Supreme Court’s June 2013 holding in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. In that case, the Court held that a naturally occurring segment of DNA is a product of nature and is not patent-eligible subject matter simply because it has been isolated from its naturally occurring state. If the C. immunda genetic strain could only be obtained through synthetic means, then it would stand a much better chance under the Myriad standard, but even the synthetic production of a genetic sequence which does occur in nature would very likely be considered unpatentable subject matter.



A correct understanding of how patent rights as private property help to ensure that such innovations are properly commercialized would lead a rational observer to the understanding that the Mayo/Myriad framework on patentability makes such scientific discoveries less impactful on a society. If a subject matter is unpatentable, businesses operating in those fields will attract far less investment because they have no ability to protect their innovations. In the event that a business does fail, it’s often the intellectual property assets, especially patents, which can be sold off during liquidation in order to recoup investors money.
If uncertain patentability in a given sector can affect investment into that sector, then the problem of uncertain patentability is especially daunting in sectors which require the development of basic research. As of 2013, the average cost of developing a medicine that was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was $5 billion. If it costs billions to bring a medical diagnostic technology based on the recent discovery regarding GIRK1 protein expression in breast cancer patients, a patent on the technology will be necessary. Otherwise, investors won’t spend money to develop a technology that could be easily copied by a rival firm who might have a stronger model of distribution, thus hurting the ability of the original innovator to claim the market which is rightly theirs.
Further issues facing the patentability of subject matter related to natural phenomena also stem from recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, specifically that Court’s June 2014 decision in Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International, a case which created a two-step standard for adjudicating a patent’s validity when the patent is directed to a process or method. In the first step of the Alice test, courts are instructed to determine whether elements of the patented claims are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter; in the second step, if it is determined that the claims are indeed directed to patent-ineligible matter, then the court determines whether the claims elements, both individually and as an ordered combination, transform the nature of the claims to become patent-eligible subject matter.
Applying the Alice standard to any patent covering a useful technology derived from either of the scientific discoveries at the top of this article and it’s easy to see the writing on the wall in terms of a firm’s ability to protect its investment under the current law. The expression of GIRK1 protein occurs naturally in patients, thus any process which uses GIRK1 as a biomarker for breast cancer diagnoses would seem to fail step one of the Alice test. The patent would likely fail step two of Alice because the process in which GIRK1 levels are measured is conventional; it’s the novelty of GIRK1 as a breast cancer biomarker, and not the process of finding the biomarker itself, which is the discovery. And thus, breast cancer patients suffer because a superior diagnostic technology has a much tougher time making its way to the market, and it’s all thanks to the Supreme Court.
It would be a very similar story in regards to any patents covering processes for hydrocarbon degradation using the genetic sequence culled from the C. immunda fungus. That bacterial genetic sequence occurs naturally, thus failing step one of Alice. The patent then fails at step two because the combination of the elements of the claims, likely involving the known and conventional processes for isolating genetic material, fails to transform the claim into what the Supreme Court considers as patent-eligible subject matter.
These aren’t simply patent rights issues at this point. The uncertainty of patentability in medical and life sciences fields is simply untenable at a time during which the whole world clamors for innovations which could make both humans and our surrounding environment healthier. The Supreme Court hasn’t just held back the rights of patent owners, they’ve arrested the progress of the entire American society in terms of better medical and environmental technologies.

Crossing the pacific


Unfavourable environments for business method patents in the US have led to an increase of filings in Asia. Benjamin Keim of Lee & Hayes explainsIn the US, business method patents have become more difficult to obtain following the US Supreme Court’s decision in Alice Corp v CLS Bank. 

Analysis of US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejections after the Alice decision shows a large increase in the number rejections for lack of patent eligible subject matter under section 101 of the US Patent Act, and a corresponding decrease in the allowance rates for certain categories of inventions. 

This change is most dramatic in art units that examine business methods. In the two years following the Alice decision, the percent of applications receiving a rejection under section 101 in some art units jumped from around 40 percent to over 90 percent. These art units examine technology in areas such as business processing, eshopping, finance and banking, incentive programmes, and operations research. Accordingly, allowance rates in these art units have decreased following Alice. For business process applications, prior to the Alice decision there was a low allowance rate of 9 percent, which dropped further to only 2 percent.

Other areas had larger percentage changes. Eshopping applications had an allowance rate of 27 percent prior to Alice that decreased to 9 percent, while the finance and banking art unit’s allowance rate declined from 24 percent to only 3 percent. Obtaining meaningful patent protection for some types of business method inventions has become significantly more difficult at the USPTO than it was five or 10 years ago. 

This has caused some applicants to forego filing applications on business method inventions. Hopefully, the decrease in patent application filings does not indicate a decrease in the amount of investment and innovation in this area. 

In the years since Alice, the US Federal Courts have provided numerous examples of computer-implemented technology that is patent eligible. The USPTO is responding to these court decisions, and pathways to allowability are increasing. 

In China and Japan, however, patent applications on business method inventions may receive favourable consideration due to recent perspective changes by the patent offices of both countries.

For inventors of new and non-obvious business methods, there is now a real possibility of obtaining meaningful patent protection in Japan and China. On 24 March 2017, the Japan Patent Office posted a webpage describing recent trends in business-related inventions. In Japan, business method patents are described as “covering a business method by using information and communication technology”. 

This definition emphasises the role of technology in patent eligible business method inventions. In Japan, allowance rates for business methods have increased dramatically from 10 percent in 2002 to 69 percent in 2012. Although more recent data is not available, it is reasonable to assume that the current allowance rate for business method patents is similar to the overall Japan Patent Office allowance rate of 70 percent. This is a vast difference from the 2 percent, 3 percent, or 9 percent allowance rates of some art units in the USPTO. This increase in allowance rate has taken place while the popularity of business method applications has grown. 

The number of applications granted by the Japan Patent Office has steadily increased year after year from about 750 applications in 2002 to about 1,900 applications in 2012. Notably, the total number of individual claims filed in business method applications has been increasing since the end of 2009 while the total number of claims filed across all technologies with the Japan Patent Office has decreased slightly. 

To see if the reported behaviors of the USPTO and the Japan Patent Office matched the experiences of our clients, we reviewed a set of applications filed in the US that were ultimately abandoned and that had an issued counterpart patent in Japan. Of the abandoned US applications, 55 percent had section 101 rejections that referenced Alice at the time of abandonment. For the 20 percent that had only Alice rejections at the time of abandonment, it is reasonable to assume that absent of the Alice decision—or a change in the way the Alice decision is applied by the USPTO—these US applications would have issued like their Japanese counterparts. 

However, 70 percent of the abandoned US applications had obviousness rejections under section 103 of the Patent Act at the time of abandonment. Therefore, although patent eligibility may be a differentiator between allowances in the US and Japan, it may be important to note that obviousness was a more common reason for rejection in the abandoned US applications. For US applications that had both section 101 and section 103 rejections at the time of abandonment, applicants may have elected to allow the applications to become abandoned because of the section 101 rejection rather than file a potentially successful response to the section 103 rejection. 

Responding to an Alice rejection by abandoning an application is an option selected by many applicants. Almost 20 percent of all applications at the USPTO are abandoned after receiving an Alice rejection. 

Since 1 April 2017, the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) has operated under new patent examination guidelines that strengthen protection for software and allow for patenting of business methods. Prior to this change business methods were not patentable in China. The new guidelines indicate that SIPO, like the Japan Patent Office, views the combination of business methods and computer technology favorably. The guidelines state: “If a claim related to a business model involves not only content of business rules and methods but also a technical feature, it shall not be excluded from the possibility of being granted a patent right.”

The revisions also remove an example that indicated a system for learning a foreign language as patent ineligible. The explanation for the now deleted example explained that the claims were patent ineligible because the invention used well-known electronic equipment and the improvement in teaching was not a technical improvement. Analysis by ignoring well-known components and searching for a technical improvement solely in the remainder of a claim is difficult to rebut effectively, and is an analytical technique applied by US courts, the USPTO, and other jurisdictions, such as the European Patent Office. 

By deleting this example from the guidelines, SIPO is asking examiners to make a more holistic analysis of how the business method and the technical features interact to achieve a particular solution. This should enable SIPO examiners to find that many inventions designed to work on ordinary computers are patent eligible. The amendments to the examination guidelines also permit claims to computer-readable storage media if the stored computer program provides a technical solution to a technical problem and claims to an apparatus that includes programme modules. Both were previously patent ineligible subject matter in China. This brings the scope of potential claim styles and patentable subject matter in China closer to that of the US. It remains to be seen how SIPO examiners will apply the new guidelines in practice.

We also reviewed a set of abandoned US patent applications of our clients that had a counterpart application issued in China. In contrast to the results we found when looking at applications with issued counterparts in Japan, none of the abandoned US applications had rejections for section 101 at the time of abandonment. The grounds of rejection were split 25 percent for anticipation and 75 percent for obviousness. The lack of section 101 rejections in the abandoned US applications may be due to the difficulty of patenting business methods in China before the recent change in examination guidelines. It would have been a rare invention that was both patent eligible in China and drew an Alice rejection in the US. The difference between Japan and China may also be due to the small sample size. We found only a handful of Chinese patents with abandoned US counterparts.

Five or 10 years ago US applicants were filing in Japan more than in China. Without a change in the US law, going forward we expect to see an increase in the number of issued Chinese patents on business methods with an abandoned US counterpart due to both the new guidelines and increased filing in China.

The most favorable patent office for applications on business method inventions may have shifted from the US to another jurisdiction such as Japan or China. Innovators, even those focused mainly on the US market, should consider seeking patent protection for business method inventions in multiple jurisdictions. 

Patent coverage in multiple jurisdictions, even if the US is not included, may discourage a global competitor from developing an infringing product or service and may provide leverage for cross licensing. Using the Japan Patent Office or SIPO as the office of first filing can provide applicants an evaluation of novelty and nonobviousness without the confounding effects of Alice. An allowance from the Japan Patent Office or SIPO may even influence a patent examiner at the USPTO to allow an application that might otherwise be rejected particularly if combined with use of the Patent Prosecution Highway.

Blockchain IP risks and how to manage them: Reddie & Grose,https://www.worldipreview.com/article/blockchain-ip-risks-and-how-to-manage-them,"
cnythzl / iStockphoto.com
With the increasing use and importance of blockchain technology, IP risks will be inevitable. Chris Smith of Reddie & Grose examines how companies might overcome these obstacles.
To say that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology have attracted a lot of attention in the past decade would be an understatement. Described by some as a “disruptive technology”, it is predicted to revolutionise banks and other financial institutions, but also to have a wide range of other applications. This has led to huge investments in research and development, with banks and big tech companies rushing into the field and a flush of new blockchain-focused startups. It is worth therefore giving some thought to the IP risks facing such companies and what steps they can take to manage them.
The ever-rising interest in blockchain technology can be measured by the filing figures of blockchain patent applications, which can be seen to increase year on year since blockchain first appeared (see here). This is despite blockchain technology’s being on the fringe of patentable subject matter and its having becoming considerably more difficult to obtain a US patent for inventions made in this field as a result of the US Supreme Court’s decision in Alice Corp v CLS Bank International.
“The copyright and open source risk is something that can be controlled by companies because the particular licence terms of each blockchain project can be reviewed.”

Guest Post: Patent Office Shows New Respect for Software | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2018/08/patent-respect-software.html,"
Guest Post from Richard P. Beem.  Beem’s firm handled the Intelligent Medical Objects case discussed below. – DC
Software patents and applications are making a quiet comeback under Director Andrei Iancu’s leadership of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This is a welcome shift, since thousands of applications have been held captive in the Office in the wake of Supreme Court decisions culminating in Alice v. CLS Bank, 134 S.Ct. 2347 (2014).
In the hands of reductionists, the Alice formula for rejection/invalidation was easy to apply. Every invention can be reduced to an abstract idea. Whatever is left can be explained away as “routine” or “conventional.” In the last four years, many software patent applications suffered repeated rejection and the ignoble death of abandonment for lack of will or lack of funds. Even when granted, many software patents were mowed down in inter partes review (IPR) in the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).
The Federal Circuit’s February 2018 decision in Berkheimer, 881 F.3d 1360 (citing Alice and other authority), paved the way for recent progress, holding that when there are genuine issues of material fact concerning alleged routineness or conventionality, evidence of the same must be presented before patent claims properly can be invalidated on such grounds.
Berkheimer was an appeal from an inter partes district court litigation. What hope does Berkheimer hold for software patent applicants in ex parte proceedings in the Patent Office?
My firm and I took an appeal from a final rejection to the PTAB, In re Naeymi-Rad et al., Appeal 2016-005478, where the rejection was affirmed in a lengthy opinion, and thence to the Federal Circuit, where the case was renamed for the assignee, In re Intelligent Medical Objects, Appeal 18-1586 [Federal Circuit Order].
Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO) is the world’s leading provider of medical vocabulary that allows doctors to capture and preserve truth (or clinical intent) at the point of care. In the course of its work, IMO invented a method of creating and maintaining a “longitudinal” (over the course of several visits) electronic medical record (LEMR) with software that runs on a general purpose (albeit high powered) computer.
Several patents were granted to IMO, each directed to a different aspect of the LEMR, before one examiner dug in with a final rejection in the case at bar, in which the claims were directed to a method of implementing an LEMR with a controlled medical vocabulary. The final rejection was based solely on alleged abstractness under 35 U.S.C. 101; earlier rejections based on Sections 102 and 103 were overcome.
The examiner in the IMO case turned the claims into clichés of “providing healthcare” and “generating and processing medical records.” Typical of such cases, the examiner restated the claimed method even more generally as “collecting, storing, and organizing data.” This is a formula for finding claims to be abstract. The examiner and the PTAB found IMO’s novel use of pointers and directed graphs, taken out of context, to be merely routine and conventional, without citing any evidence, and they shifted the burden to IMO to prove the contrary.
We filed appellant IMO’s principal brief in the Federal Circuit at the end of May 2018. Within a few days, the Patent Office filed an unopposed motion to vacate the PTAB decision. Shortly thereafter, the Federal Circuit issued its opinion, vacating the PTAB decision and remanding the application to the Office for further proceedings. In re Intelligent Medical Objects, Appeal 18-1586 (slip op. June 27, 2018).
The IMO decision and a similar decision in In re Allscripts Software, LLC, Appeal 2018-1451 (Fed. Cir. slip op., June 27, 2018) were the subject of a blog post “Berkheimer, the Administrative Procedure Act and PTO Motions to Vacate PTAB § 101 Decisions,” in IP Watchdog (July 16, 2018), praising the Patent Office for acknowledging the Berkheimer decision and doing the right thing in the two Federal Circuit appeals.
Meanwhile, in April 2018, the Patent Office issued new guidance for examination of software patent applications. That guidance makes it clear that software patent claims cannot legally be rejected without grounds supported by evidence. There will be more guidance from the Office, and there will be more opinions from the Federal Circuit.
Notwithstanding the substantial and growing body of legal authority, however, there will be further erroneous rejections of software patent claims. Many of those rejections will be maintained, and a few of those will be taken on appeal. It is only a matter of time before the Federal Circuit issues one or more published opinions holding that Berkheimer applies in ex parte patent prosecution.
Published Federal Circuit opinions are the tip of the iceberg. But, ah, the cost to applicants! And for every successful appellant, there are 10, 20 or more applicants who sadly accede to final rejections and abandon worthy applications. This is a not a good outcome from a patent system that is intended to promote the progress of technology by issuing patents for meritorious inventions.
Some of the greatest challenges facing the world today will be solved with new and improved software. The need for better electronic medical records is one example. Another, literally inside the Patent Office, is the need to manage ever-growing terabytes of data without crashing electronic filing and retrieval systems. Hacking and cybercrimes often take advantage of shortcomings in software; better cybersecurity will depend on better software. Many of these issues are technical problems that will be solved with novel, non-obvious, applied technical solutions.
Such software inventions are deserving of patent protection. Director Iancu is to be applauded for his recent acknowledgements of legal errors in final rejections appealed to the Federal Circuit.
As for patent applicants, owners, and attorneys, the patent system is not and never will be perfect. Skillful drafting and prosecution go a long way toward obtaining allowance of claims directed to deserving inventions. In some cases, appeals even to the Federal Circuit may be necessary, and, as in the cases of Intelligent Medical Objects and Allscripts Software, they may win.

"BlackBerry Sues Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp for Willful Infringement of Mobile Communications Patents - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law",http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/03/24/blackberry-sues-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-patent-infringement/id=94984/,"
On March 6th, Canadian intellectual property owner BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) filed a suit alleging patent infringement claims against Menlo Park, CA-based social media giant Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) in the Central District of California. BlackBerry alleges that Facebook, along with its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram, violate patents held by BlackBerry in the field of mobile messaging communications.
BlackBerry’s complaint asserts a total of seven patents-in-suit, including:

U.S. Patent No. 7372961, titled Method of Public Key Generation. Issued in March 2008, it claims a method for generating a key for use in a cryptographic function which avoids a potential bias affecting the generation of private keys.
U.S. Patent No. 8209634, titled Previewing a New Event on a Small Screen Device. Issued in June 2012, it claims a method of providing notifications of unread messages on a wireless communication device by visually modifying a displayed icon for the messaging application to include a numeric number representing a count of received messages that have gone unread.
U.S. Patent No. 8301713, titled Handheld Electronic Device and Associated Method Providing Time Data in a Messaging Environment. Issued in October 2012, it discloses a method of operating an electronic device which provides users of messaging applications with time data in certain situations, such as when a conversation has been interrupted. 
U.S. Patent No. 8677250, titled System and Method for Switching Between an Instant Messaging Conversation and a Game in Progress. Issued in March 2014, it covers a method of enabling a game to be played on an electronic device which enables a game application in the device to access the contact list of an instant messaging application to communicate a game message to particular contacts.

As BlackBerry’s complaint notes, it has been a leader in the development of mobile communications for the past 30 years and its innovations led to the commercialization of some of the earliest smartphone models available in the U.S. It has attained many mobile messaging patents, including those asserted against Facebook, which cover improved security, improved user interfaces, battery-efficient status updates and combined gaming/messaging platforms.
Facebook’s alleged infringement stems back to August 2011 when it released its Facebook Messenger application more than six years after the release of BlackBerry Messenger. WhatsApp and Instagram, which Facebook would acquire later in separate deals, also released their messaging platforms after BlackBerry Messenger had allegedly invented most of the technologically innovative messaging features at issue in the case. The success of BlackBerry Messenger relative to Facebook’s messaging services was further argued by citing to the Android and iPhone download statistics for BlackBerry’s messaging application for both of those mobile platforms. Within eight hours, the BlackBerry app was downloaded 5 million times and, within two years, that total would grow to 100 million.
Each count of infringement which BlackBerry brings in the suit also includes arguments as to why each of the inventions covered by the asserted patents were not well-understood, routine or conventional at the time that they were patented. BlackBerry alleges that the patents-in-suit disclose unconventional solutions to issues specifically arising in the context of mobile communications devices. Persons having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the inventions would not have understood that the inventions could have been performed in either the human mind or by pen and paper. Such arguments would seem to designed to head off any invalidity challenges under 35 U.S.C. § 101, the basic statute governing the patentability of inventions. In cases like Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International, patents covering software inventions have been invalidated on the argument that the underlying software is merely an abstract idea. This style of getting ahead of a Section 101 invalidity argument was also recently seen in a case filed by Portal Communications that alleged Apple willfully infringed on patents covering natural language processing with its Siri digital personal assistant.
Along with a judgment declaring that the defendants have infringed the patents-in-suit, BlackBerry is also seeking an injunction preventing the use of Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Facebook Messenger Lite, Facebook Workplace Chat, Facebook Pages Manager, WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram applications. BlackBerry is also seeking enhanced damages under 35 U.S.C. § 284 for willful infringement.

USPTO Updates Section 101 Based Rejections,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/uspto-updates-examination-guidelines-patent-eligible-subject-matter,"
As noted in our recent update “Factual Questions May Preclude Early Resolution of Invalidity Under Section 101,” the Federal Circuit recently recognized that when determining whether a patent claim is directed to patent eligible subject matter, the “question of whether a claim element or combination of elements is well-understood, routine and conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant field is a question of fact.”1 In both Berkheimer and Aatrix2, the Federal Circuit was exploring this issue in the context of litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has now followed suit and issued a memo on April 19, 2018, to the Patent Examining Corps updating examination guidelines for Section 101 rejections based on the Berkheimer and Aatrix decisions (“Memo”).3 The Memo addresses the second step of the two-step inquiry established by the Supreme Court in Alice where (1) a determination is first made as to whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent ineligible concept and (2) if so, whether the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application.4
Although previous guidance to the Examining Corps recognized the Alice two-step inquiry5, the Memo now provides a more structured approach to Section 101 rejections with a recognition that the factual issues underlying the patent eligibility question must be addressed by examiners with particularity, and with an evidence-based approach. The new guidelines emphasize that “an examiner should conclude that an element (or combination of elements) represents well-understood, routine, conventional activity only when the examiner can readily conclude that the element(s) is widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant industry.”6 Significantly, the Memo further emphasizes that “[t]he question of whether additional elements represent well-understood, routine, conventional activity is distinct from patentability over the prior art under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103.”7 This important distinction is express recognition that “[t]he mere fact that something is disclosed in a piece of prior art…does not mean it was well-understood, routine and conventional.”8
According to the Memo, in formulating a rejection under Section 101, the new guidelines require that the “examiner finds, and expressly supports a rejection in writing with, one or more of [four criteria outlined in the Memo.] First, the examiner may support a Section 101 rejection with an express citation to the specification or to a statement in the file history by the applicant “that demonstrates the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s).”9 With this guidance, it is imperative that applicants use caution in both drafting the specification and presenting arguments in responses that could be construed as such an admission. Second, the examiner may rely on prior court decisions “noting the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional elements.”10 Third, the examiner may cite to a publication that demonstrates that an element or combination of elements would be understood as conventional in the art. In this regard, it was again emphasized, however, that “a document may be a printed publication but still fail to establish that something it describes is well-understood, routine, and conventional activity.”11 A passing reference in an obscure publication, for example, may not be sufficient to show that some element or combination of elements is indeed “well-understood, routine and conventional.” This point may provide fertile ground for applicants to argue against Section 101 rejections. Finally, the examiner may take “official notice of the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s).”12 If, however, the applicant challenges this assertion, the burden shifts back to the examiner to provide evidence to document this assertion.
The new USPTO guidelines will require examiners to more thoroughly address Section 101 rejections and provide a clear evidentiary basis for the rejection. These guidelines should provide a clearer record for the public while also providing a sound basis for applicants to challenge a poorly supported rejection. Thus, both patent quality and acceptance rates for patent applications may be improved by these newly announced guidelines.

Claim reciting results achieved by general computer technology directed to unpatentable abstract idea - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/08/02/claim-reciting-results-achieved-unpatentable-abstract-idea/id=99776/,"
Recently, the Federal Circuit affirmed a judgment finding patent claims asserted by the patent owner, Interval Licensing, failed to recite patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101. See Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc. (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2018) (Before Taranto, Plager, and Chen, J.) (Opinion for the court, Chen, J.) (Concurrence-in part, Dissent-in part, Plager, J.).
The patent related to an “attention manager” for a “display device,” which could make use of “unused capacity” by showing content in unused portions of the display. The “attention manager” could display secondary content in an area not covered with primary content, or when the “display device” was turned on, but not actively engaged by a user (e.g. a computer wallpaper).
Under Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l, courts evaluate claims under a two-part test for patent eligibility. 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). Step one of the Alice test considers whether the claims, when considered in their entirety, are “directed to” a judicial exception to patent eligibility under § 101. The judicial exceptions are laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. If the claims are directed to a judicial exception, the court must move to step two, which considers whether the claims contain an “inventive concept sufficient to transform the nature of the claim[s] into a patent-eligible application.”
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment. Under Alice step one, the Court noted that the claims were directed to “providing information to a person without interfering with the person’s primary activity,” which is an abstract idea. This idea was longstanding in society, exemplified by a breaking news ticker across the bottom of a television screen or passing a note to someone in a meeting. The Court further found that the “attention manager” encompassed a patent-ineligible abstract concept because it “demand[ed] the production of [the] desired result” of solving problems related to displaying information in “multitasking operation systems,” but did not explain how the result was achieved or place “any limitation on how to produce that result” beyond the use of general computer functions.
The Court proceeded to an analysis under Alice step two and found that the claims did not transform their abstract idea into a patent-eligible application. The claims did not recite an inventive method for how secondary information would be displayed on a device, “such as what portion of the screen is utilized or how the primary activity on the screen is monitored”. Additionally, the claims were so broad that they “encompass[ed] the basic concept of displaying two sets of information.” Therefore, the claims were directed to abstract, patent-ineligible subject matter.
Judge Plager’s Dissent
In dissent, Judge Plager criticized the “abstract idea” framework under Alice. He argued first that the concept of an “abstract idea” is extremely difficult to apply in patent cases because the term is by definition “abstract,” meaning “difficult to understand,” and an “idea,” which is “something that lives in the interstices of someone’s brain, a psychophysiological area not fully understood to this day.” Judge Plager also noted that ideas can have an “infinite range of abstractness,” comparing the more concrete idea of “let’s have hamburgers for dinner” with the highly theoretical idea of making “time go backwards.”
Judge Plager went on to state that the “abstract idea” definition, “when used for denying a claimed invention’s patent eligibility . . . cannot thus function as a rule of law.” He proffered that rules of law should predict how courts will decide future cases, but that the “abstract idea” standard, much like the law of obscenity, is based on an “I’ll know it when I see it” approach that is difficult to both predict in future cases and review on appeal.
Finally, Judge Plager noted that there is “little consensus” among judges regarding whether a patent case has claims directed to an abstract idea, and if so if there is an ‘inventive concept’ sufficient to save the claims. Therefore, the “abstract idea” defense “does not distinguish good [patents] from ill in any coherent sense, and thus does not serve well either patent law or the public.”
Take Away
A patent claim is directed to an abstract idea when the claim is centered on a result or the solution to a problem without explaining how the result is achieved or the problem is solved except by using general computer technology.

Federal Circuit Denies En Banc Review of Berkheimer and Aatrix | McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff LLP - JDSupra,http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/federal-circuit-denies-en-banc-review-60074/,"


	One of the more substantive questions in the recent interpretation of what encompasses patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 is whether facts should play any role in the analysis.  The Supreme Court has not been perfectly clear on this issue, and the Federal Circuit appears to have taken both sides at various times.  In last week's denial of en banc review for two cases, the Federal Circuit answered with an emphatic ""yes.""  Thus, the question seems resolved.  For now.

Background

	It all started with Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l.  There, the Supreme Court set forth a two-part test to determine whether claims are directed to patent-eligible subject matter under § 101.  One must first decide whether the claim at hand is directed to a judicially-excluded law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea.  If so, then one must further decide whether any element or combination of elements in the claim is sufficient to ensure that the claim amounts to significantly more than the judicial exclusion.  But generic computer implementation of an otherwise abstract process does not qualify as ""significantly more,"" nor will elements that are well-understood, routine, and conventional lift the claim over the § 101 hurdle.

	While the Supreme Court did not specify whether the well-understood, routine, and conventional determination was to be carried out as a matter of law, fact, or a hybrid of both, its earlier Mayo Collaborative Srvs. v. Prometheus Labs, Inc. decision strongly suggested that the § 101 inquiry may overlap with fact-sensitive inquiries such as novelty under § 102 in at least some situations.  However, the Federal circuit has stated, in OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., that ""[p]atent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101 is an issue of law reviewed de novo.""  But in other cases, different panels have implied that facts may be considered.

	In February, the Federal Circuit published two decisions attempting to flesh out the role of facts in the § 101 analysis.  In Berkheimer vs. HP Inc., the Court stated:

	The question of whether a claim element or combination of elements is well-understood, routine and conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant field is a question of fact.  Any fact . . . that is pertinent to the invalidity conclusion must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.  Like indefiniteness, enablement, or obviousness, whether a claim recites patent eligible subject matter is a question of law which may contain underlying facts [emphasis added].

	The outcome of the Court's factual analysis was that some of Berkheimer's dependent claims recite ""limitations directed to the arguably unconventional inventive concept described in the specification"" and therefore the case was remanded to the District Court for fact finding.

	Quickly following Berkheimer was Aatrix Software Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., where the Court further explained that it has held that patent eligibility can be determined on the pleadings, but that ""[t]his is true only when there are no factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.""  On the other hand, ""[i]f there are claim construction disputes . . . either the court must proceed by adopting the non-moving party's constructions . . . or the court must resolve the disputes to whatever extent is needed to conduct the § 101 analysis, which may well be less than a full, formal claim construction.""  Particularly, the patentee's pleadings contained specific allegations regarding the technical improvements of, and problems solved by, the claimed invention.  This was enough to also remand the case back to District Court.

	The parties that came up on the short end of both of these decisions requested en banc review.  The Federal Circuit published two identical opinions denying both petitions.  As we have come to expect from § 101 decisions in the Federal Circuit, these cases are not without controversy.  While seven of twelve judges of the en banc Court agreed with the denials (providing two different concurrences), one judge dissented.

Judge Moore's Concurrence

	The first concurrence was authored by Judge Moore (who also wrote the Berkheimer and Aatrix opinions).  She was joined by judges Dyk, O'Malley, Taranto, and Stoll.

	Judge Moore begins with a bang, stating that ""Berkheimer and Aatrix stand for the unremarkable proposition that whether a claim element or combination of elements would have been well-understood, routine, and conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant field at a particular point in time is a question of fact.""  After noting that the Supreme Court did leave the door open to this conclusion in Mayo, her argument is largely procedural.  She states that § 282(a) places the evidentiary burden of invalidating a claim on the challenger, and that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that where there is a genuine dispute of material fact on summary judgment, the motion is to be denied.  Similarly, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be denied when viewed ""in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and with every doubt resolved in the pleader's favor—but disregarding mere conclusory statements—the complaint states any legally cognizable claim for relief.""

	She digs deeper by observing that ""[i]n a situation where the specification admits the additional claim elements are well-understood, routine, and conventional, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for a patentee to show a genuine dispute.""  But extrinsic sources, such as a pleadings or expert testimony, could raise such a genuine dispute (so long as the points being made are not conclusory or otherwise disqualifying).

	Judge Moore also makes it clear that the existence of such a factual dispute does not resolve the patent eligibility of the claims, but does require a factual inquiry:

	We cannot adopt a result-oriented approach to end patent litigation at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage that would fail to accept as true the complaint's factual allegations and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as settled law requires.  The conclusion that the patent claims in Aatrix survived the motion to dismiss is not a holding that they are eligible.  And the mere fact that there were sufficient allegations in the pleading to state a claim for patent infringement does not mean that the case need go to trial.

	Instead, a determination of invalidity on the pleadings can be proper when there is no genuine factual dispute or when such a dispute has been resolved in the favor of the challenger.  Thus, according to Judge Moore, Berkheimer and Aatrix are consistent with Federal Circuit precedent that has ""properly permitted pretrial resolution of many eligibility disputes.""

Judge Lourie's Concurrence

	The next concurrence was written by Judge Lourie and joined by Judge Newman.  In it, he appears to send up a red flag regarding § 101 jurisprudence in general, stating that ""I believe the law needs clarification by higher authority, perhaps by Congress, to work its way out of what so many in the innovation field consider are § 101 problems.""

	He suggests that the simple § 101 inquiry set forth in the statute has become too complicated:  ""We now are interpreting what began, when it rarely arose, as a simple § 101 analysis, as a complicated multiple-step consideration of inventiveness (""something more""), with the result that an increasing amount of inventive research is no longer subject to patent.""  But Judge Lourie's proposed solution is to combine both steps of Alice into one:

	But why should there be a step two in an abstract idea analysis at all?  If a method is entirely abstract, is it no less abstract because it contains an inventive step?  And, if a claim recites ""something more,"" an ""inventive"" physical or technological step, it is not an abstract idea, and can be examined under established patentability provisions such as §§ 102 and 103.  Step two's prohibition on identifying the something more from ""computer functions that are 'well-understood, routine, conventional activities' previously known to the industry,"" is essentially a §§ 102 and 103 inquiry.  Section 101 does not need a two-step analysis to determine whether an idea is abstract.

	Consequently, Judge Lourie calls for the higher authority to sort things out.  He sums up by stating that ""[e]ven if [the denial of en banc review] was decided wrongly, which I doubt, it would not work us out of the current § 101 dilemma . . . [i]n fact, it digs the hole deeper by further complicating the § 101 analysis.""

Judge Reyna's Dissent

	As the sole dissenting voice, Judge Reyna employs a multi-prong attack on the reasoning set forth in the concurrences.  His initial point is that, in his view, ""there is no precedent that the § 101 inquiry is a question of fact.""  Furthermore, he believes that, under Berkheimer and Aatrix, eligibility is predominately a factual issue rather than an analysis that may consider some types of facts in certain situations.  According to Judge Reyna, ""Step two is thus divorced from the claims.""

	He also criticizes the Court for offering no ""meaningful guidance to the bar, the government, or the public on how to proceed on these new grounds,"" contending that ""we have no established parameters or guidance for what evidence we can and should consider for inventive concept purposes.""  His parade of horribles includes a number of purportedly unanswered questions:

	Does this new factual inquiry extend to other aspects of the § 101 inquiry, such as whether a claim is directed to an abstract idea or a natural phenomenon?  Can expert opinion supplant the written description?  Does the court or jury determine this factual issue?  What deference is due to the fact finder?

	Like Judge Moore, Judge Reyna also discusses the role of extrinsic evidence in the factual inquiry.  But he finds that ""Aatrix removes the inventive concept inquiry from the claims and the specification, and instead places it firmly in the realm of extrinsic evidence . . . [which] is a change in our law, and is counter to guidance from the Supreme Court and our own precedent.""  Particularly, Judge Reyna is concerned that, given these decisions, there is no reason why the factual inquiry cannot be applied to step one of Alice as well.

	But to support his concerns, he relies on statements from Diamond vs. Diehr regarding the complete separateness of the § 101 inquiry from those of § 102 and § 103.  This point ignores Mayo's explicit statement that overlap may exist, Alice's reinforcement thereof, and the indisputable reality that, in practice, whether a claim element is well-understood, routine, and conventional is a factual analysis.

	Judge Reyna goes on to make an analogy between a patent and contract.  Each should be evaluated as a matter of law and the analysis should be limited to the four corners of the document, with factual matters rarely needing consideration.  He also makes a further analogy to claim construction:  ""When construing patent claims, the court may rely on factual findings in some instances, but predominately construes the terms according to the claims and specification, i.e., a purely legal determination.""

Conclusion

	Regardless of one's position regarding the now-final outcomes of Berkheimer and Aatrix in the Federal Circuit, it is undeniable these cases are the most significant to be decided with regard to § 101 since Alice.  While it remains to be seen how broadly they are applied, they have added a new twist to the eligibility analysis.

	The next question, though, is whether either or both will be taken up by the Supreme Court (assuming that one of the parties requests certiorari, which is likely).  On one hand, Berkheimer and Aatrix involve interactions between patentability and federal procedure that may pique the Supreme Court's interest, and may also afford it an opportunity to clarify (or further muddy) what it meant in Mayo and Alice.  On the other hand, the Supreme Court may observe that the Federal Circuit is largely in agreement on the issue, and therefore may allow the lower court to scope out what can be well-understood, routine, and conventional for a while longer.

Patent ‘Trolls’ Recede as Threat to Innovation. Will Justices Change That? - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/business/economy/patents-trolls-supreme-court.html,"Researchers at the University of California Hastings College of the Law found that three-quarters of the drugs associated with new patents in the records of the Food and Drug Administration were not new drugs coming on the market, but existing drugs. Pharmaceutical companies extended their exclusivity over blockbuster drugs 80 percent of the time, attaching new patents on dosage and other aspects that had nothing to do with the original invention.Here’s how it works: Pharmaceutical companies start moving doctors to the tweaked formulation before the initial patent runs out, so that by the time it expires nobody is prescribing the original drug. That gives them an extra 20 years of exclusivity in which they can charge patients and their insurance companies exorbitant fees. Society has nothing to gain.In a brief to the court, the Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge — a nonprofit group arguing for broader access to affordable medicines — argued that the patent office’s panel “is an important and necessary tool in the fight to lower drug prices because it allows the timely removal of unmerited patents, which promotes competition.”Tahir Amin, a co-executive director of the initiative, added that “there are a lot of patent trolls trying to extort rents from low-quality patents.”The Supreme Court has in recent years shown itself sympathetic to the argument that patent protections have become too restrictive. On half a dozen occasions since 2013, it has overturned decisions by Federal District Courts granting patent rights over what were ultimately fairly intuitive processes.Notably, the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International held that where a patent claim is based on an abstract idea, which is not patentable, using generic computer implementation does not transform that idea into a patentable invention.Corporate interests are not aligned in this case, though. Pharmaceutical companies despise the patent office’s new powers. Information-technology corporations, which incorporate thousands of ideas into one gadget and see themselves as victims of patent trolls, are strong supporters of this relatively cheap and expedient avenue to challenge patents once they have been written.The Goliaths of technology are, of course, out for themselves alone. Yet in this case they are aligned with the economy’s interest. For too long, innovation has been narrowed to fit patent holders’ argument for sacrosanct property rights. For these rights to hold, however, at the very least we need a system to undo those that prove to be invalid.",0,,,,,0.0,0.0
Apple Files Patent for Recognizing Whispered Voice Commands - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/01/20/apple-files-patent-whispered-voice-commands/id=92461/,"
In a Research and Markets report released March 2017, the number of active virtual digital assistant (VDA) users worldwide was expected to increase from 390 million users in 2015 to 1.8 billion by the end of 2021. The same report said that VDA revenue should increase to $15.8 billion in 2021, up from $1.6 billion in 2015. According to an eMarketer report released in May 2017, 60.5 million people in the United States alone will use an assistant that recognizes voice commands once a month during 2017, which represents more than one quarter of U.S. smartphone users or nearly one in five Americans.
The Siri virtual digital assistant can be found in Apple products like the iPhone. 98 percent of iPhone users have at least tried the Siri VDA. The usage of VDA services such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google Now and Microsoft Cortana was projected to grow by 23.1 percent in 2017, according to eMarketer. In 2017 it appeared as though Alexa was the dominant app as early as January, according to Business Insider.
By July 2017, Apple’s Siri had 41.4 million users, the largest user base among all VDAs, yet that number represented a decline in Siri’s user base of  about 15 percent since 2016. In September, it was reported that Amazon’s Echo held 76 percent of the market of voice-enabled speakers, marking a large consumer shift towards Alexa. In response to disappointing user engagement, Apple is forced to continue to pursue innovations to its own Siri digital assistant.
Apple only sold from 30 million to 35 million iPhone X units this holiday season, about 10 million less than previous estimates for the 2017 holiday season. Through 2017, however, the iPhone still outsold the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 overall, the iPhone selling 223 million units while Samsung only sold 33 million units of its rival products. Further analysis of data involving device activations showed that Apple iPhone products represented 44 percent of all new device activations during the 2017 holiday season, beating second-place Samsung which accounted for 23 percent of new activations during that time. In predictions for 2017 smartphone usage released in late 2016, forecasters said that over 90 million U.S. smartphone users would use an iPhone representing just over 40 percent of the total 223 million smartphone users in the U.S., according to the online statistics portal Statistica.

At the release of iOS 11, in September 2017, a few changes were noted in Siri’s speech. Apple had taken steps to improve Siri’s pronunciation of words and phonemes, the sounds that make up words, and recorded speakers in different locales to more closely match regional dialects like British. In a Popular Science article about Siri upgrades, it’s reported that Siri is now able to translate English spoken words into five different languages.
One digital assistant technology developed by Apple allowing Siri to respond to whispered voice commands is disclosed by U.S. Patent Application 20170358301, titled Digital Assistant Providing Whispered Speech. 
The claimed invention describes a system in which one or more programs stored in memory include instructions for receiving speech input from a user, and processors to determine whether a whispered speech response is to be provided to that user based on the speech input received. In some places, such as libraries or board meetings, the use of voice-activated digital assistants is discouraged because of the intrusion of sound, so this patent application would protect a technology that recognizes a user’s command, even when the user is whispering. The device would then respond in a similar whispered tone so as to be less distracting in quiet settings.
Of course, not all human speech is grammatically perfect and sometimes the meaning of an incomplete sentence has to be determined. Apple’s U.S. Patent No. 7478037, titled Assigning Meanings to Utterances in a Speech Recognition System, covers a machine implemented method which determines a set of possible operating contexts of a data processing system and then generates a language model for recognizing a spoken set of words received through audio input relating to each of these possible operating contexts.
In other words, the invention associates meanings with each spoken word or phrase to determine actions to be made by the device. To do this, a plurality of speech rules are generated from the user’s speech to recognize certain sequences of words or expressions. Each speech rule associates with a language model and an expression associated with the language model. This invention reduces the wait time that mobile device users experience when devices use conventional speech recognition process algorithms while providing accuracy in determining the meaning of utterances.
Speech recognition systems often have problems recognizing proper nouns, like a person’s name, which are not typically modeled in a phonetic dictionary. A technology addressing this problem is protected by Apple’s U.S. Patent No. 9721563, titled Name Recognition System.
This patent protects a process in which a machine readable non-transitory storage medium stores executable instructions which are executed by a data processing system. The execution of these instructions results in a method which stores a phonetic dictionary for speech recognition, obtains words from a user’s set of one or more databases, and receives a speech input from the user. This data processing system is responsive to speech input, and then utilizes a plurality of pronunciation guessers to determine the words; the pronunciations guessers can determine if the proper noun is the name of a location in a foreign language or a regional dialect. Additional processing produces more phonetic data derived from the speech input, and the additional phonetic data is used to form an extended phonetic dictionary unique to the user. Through processing this speech input by comparing phonemes that are detected in the speech input and compared to the phonemes within the phonetic dictionary, including the extended phonetic dictionary unique to the user, the best set of one or more possible matches is determined.
It’s interesting to see that Apple is patenting these speech recognition inventions given the implications of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. In that ruling, the Court found that patent claims involving a method for exchanging financial obligations and computer-related elements of that system were unpatentable as they were directed to an abstract idea under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Given that a system for a third-party intermediated settlement to mitigate settlement risk was found unpatentable by the Court as such a system was “a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce,” some of Apple’s inventions here could be of questionable patentability. After all, humans have likely been whispering to each other since they first began using speech, so a computer program for providing whispered speech could conceivably be considered unpatentable as directed to an abstract idea — depending upon the judge and how far they want to carry the undefined abstract idea test.
The Alice decision has made the patentability of software questionable, and it will be interesting to see whether Apple faces any Section 101 rejections for its whispered speech patent application. The Supreme Court did recognize in Alice that on some very basic level every invention starts with an idea. Perhaps that saves Apple’s whisper identification technology. One thing we’ve learned, however, is what is and what is not an abstract idea is quite subjective.

Searchmetrics wins important victory in patent infringement lawsuit - Search Engine Land,https://searchengineland.com/searchmetrics-wins-important-victory-in-patent-infringement-lawsuit-290267,"

An important ruling was issued last Friday in the four-year-old patent infringement lawsuit that SEO platform BrightEdge filed against competitor Searchmetrics. The California federal court judge sided with defendant Searchmetrics, ending a long and expensive court battle.
At issue in the federal case were five patents Brightedge claimed were being infringed upon by competitive SEO platform Searchmetrics. Searchmetrics successfully argued that the patents owned by Brightedge were both abstract and broad and thus did not offer an “inventive concept” that satisfied precedent (Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 2014) which ruled that abstract ideas are not patentable under Section 101 of the Patent Act — unless the claim contains an “inventive concept” that sufficiently transforms the idea into an application that then becomes patent-eligible.
In his ruling, the judge agreed, invalidating the five patents owned by Brightedge. The plaintiffs had requested that a sixth patent be amended to the suit but the judge denied this request as well, advising that they would need to file a new lawsuit to address that new/additional patent dispute.
For Searchmetrics, this is an important victory that’s been a long — and expensive — battle to win. I reached out to Searchmetrics’ CTO Marcus Tober, who said:
In our competitive industry the ruling means that we can all focus even more on what matters most: applying innovation that helps our customers to succeed online.
We also reached out to Brightedge for comment but have not received any and will update when we do.
Update January 24, 2018:
Brightedge CEO Jim Yu responded to our comment request, emphasizing the company’s priority of continuing innovation:
At BrightEdge, our number one priority is customer success and we will continue our rapid pace of innovation for the benefit of our customers and the wider search community. To this point, just last week we launched news on our 10-years of Innovation and acceleration towards being an AI first company. Innovation is at the core of everything we do, and everything we will continue to do.

CAFC Upholds Thales Motion Tracking Patent Asserted against US Gov't,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/02/13/federal-circuit-upholds-motion-tracking-patent/id=93538/,"
In recent years, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has not shown itself to be an appellate venue which has been friendly to U.S. patent owners. However, a recent decision of the Federal Circuit issued on Tuesday, February 6th, marks the latest victory for an American subsidiary of the French electrical design company Thales Group, the second time that the appellate court has upheld the validity of challenged claims from a patent which has been asserted against the United States government.
The recent Federal Circuit decision in Elbit Systems of America, LLC v. Thales Visionix, Inc. affirmed a final written decision issued by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which upheld some claims in an inter partes review (IPR) proceeding challenging the validity of Thales’ U.S. Patent No. 6474159, titled Motion Tracking and issued in November 2002. The patent claims a system for tracking the motion of an object relative to a moving reference frame using a first inertial sensor mounted on the tracked object, a second inertial sensor mounted on the moving reference frame and an element that receives signals from both inertial sensors to determine an orientation of the object relative to the moving reference frame. The resulting invention enables the use of inertial head-tracking systems for platforms including flight simulators and other vehicular applications.
Thales Visionix first asserted the ‘159 patent in a case against the United States government filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims alleging infringement created by the head-mounted display system developed for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The system, provided by defense contractor and third-party defendant Elbit Systems, includes a head-mounted display for pilots which allow them to see the airspace directly surrounding the craft as well as sensors used to label objects in the pilot’s field of view with distance, bearing and other data. The Court of Federal Claims granted Elbit’s motion for judgement on the pleadings, invalidating all asserted claims of the ‘159 patent as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101, the basic patentability statute in U.S. patent law.
On appeal, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in March 2017 which reversed the findings of the federal claims court and remanded the case for further proceeding. The Federal Circuit panel of Circuit Judges Kimberly Moore, Evan Wallach and Kara Stoll analyzed the invalidity findings through the framework of the two-step patentability test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. Finding that the patent claims at issue in the ‘159 patent were nearly indistinguishable from those at issue in Diamond v. Diehr for the purpose of evaluating patent eligibility, the Federal Circuit panel decided that the ‘159 patent claims provide a method that eliminates complications inherent in determining the position and orientation of an object on a moving platform. Because the claims in the ‘159 patent were not directed towards an abstract idea, they satisfied the Alice patentability test at step one.
Nearly two years before the Federal Circuit decided that first appeal on the ‘159 patent’s validity, Elbit filed a petition for IPR proceedings at the PTAB to challenge the validity of the ‘159 patent on 35 U.S.C. § 103 grounds for obviousness. Among the prior art asserted by Elbit as a basis for the validity trial included U.S. Patent No. 4722601 (“McFarlane”), titled Apparatus for Determining the Direction of a Line of Sight. Issued in February 1988, which claimed an apparatus for determining the direction of a line of sight relative to a predetermined frame of reference, the apparatus including a helmet containing a display device and a helmet-mounted detector providing outputs indicative of movements for the helmet relative to the frame of reference. The PTAB instituted the IPR trial in October 2015 and in a final written decision issued in October 2016, issued a mixed claim finding which invalidated 13 claims of the ‘159 patent, including claim 1. The final written decision, however, indicated that petitioner Elbit did not prove the invalidity of 11 other challenged claims of the ‘159 patent by a preponderance of the evidence.
On appeal, Elbit contends that the method of integrating the “relative angular rate signal” taught by claim 3 of the ‘159 patent, which the PTAB upheld, would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art (PHOSITA) in light of McFarlane. The Federal Circuit panel of Moore, Wallach and Stoll, the same panel upholding the ‘159 patent in the March 2017 decision, noted that Elbit’s appeal appeared “to contest the PTAB’s lack of explicit construction of ‘relative angular rate signal’ in Elbit’s favor” despite the fact that neither party challenged the PTAB’s lack of construction during the IPR proceedings, thus waiving its argument.
The Federal Circuit panel also found that substantial evidence supported the PTAB’s conclusion of nonobviousness. “It is undisputed that the method of calculating the ‘relative angular rate signal’ taught in the ’159 patent ‘is not explicitly disclosed’ in the prior art because the prior art and the Asserted Claims employ different steps to calculate the orientation or position of a moving object relative to a moving reference frame,” the Federal Circuit’s opinion reads. Whereas the McFarlane prior art taught a three-step method including two orientation calculations which are then resolved to determine relative orientation, the ‘159 patent taught a two-step method of determining a relative angular rate signal which is then used to calculate relative orientation. An expert witness for Thales had testified that this two-step method reduced both the number of calculations required to determine relative orientation and the propagation of errors which occur when using inertial sensors to track motion.
Counterarguments which were provided by Elbit on appeal were unpersuasive to the Federal Circuit panel. The contention made by Elbit’s expert that the three-step and two-step methods are mathematically equivalent was determined by the PTAB to be unsupported by the testimony given by the expert. Elbit’s argument that the asserted claims merely reorder the steps found in the prior art was undermined by the benefits of the two-step method explained by Thales expert witness. Further, although Elbit contended that the PTAB applied the incorrect legal standard because it failed to credit the knowledge of a PHOSITA, the Federal Circuit found that Elbit improperly attempted to create legal error by selectively quoting from a portion of the PTAB’s findings on the analysis of Elbit’s expert, stating that “we will not find legal error based on an isolated statement stripped from its context.”

Coca-Cola Knocks Out Soda Dispenser Patent Suit | Bloomberg Law,https://www.bna.com/cocacola-knocks-soda-n57982088917/,"


By 
      Malathi Nayak

Coca-Cola Co. succeeded in killing inventory management patents it was accused of
   infringing with some beverage dispensers.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Feb. 16, upholding a 2016 lower
   court ruling, found Automated Tracking Solutions LLC’s patents covering a specialized
   radio frequency identification (RFID) system used in inventory management were ineligible
   for patenting because they covered an abstract idea. 

The ruling helps Coca-Cola end a patent fight that threatened sales from dispensers
   such as self-serve “Coca-Cola Freestyle” touchscreen machines widely used in public
   spaces such as theaters, malls, and restaurants.

The Federal Circuit did “not see any error in the district court’s conclusion that
   the asserted claims do not possess an inventive concept sufficient to confer patent
   eligibility,” it said in its ruling. 

The Federal Circuit applied the eligibility test laid down by the Supreme Court in
   2014 in
   Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l. In that case, the high court held that an invention covering an abstract idea isn’t
   patentable unless it includes an inventive concept that takes it beyond the abstract.

Automated Tracking, a patent licensing company, sued Coca-Cola in the U.S. District
   Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2015, claiming infringement of four
   of its patents by some of the beverage maker’s soda dispensers. 

Shortly after, Coca-Cola succeeded in moving the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court
   for the Northern District of Georgia. It then filed a motion for early dismissal of
   Automatic Tracking’s patent infringement complaint before trial.

The Federal Circuit’s nonprecedential decision upheld the district court’s dismissal
   of the lawsuit in the dispute’s early stages. However, in a couple of precedential
   rulings earlier this month, it may have signaled a shift that would make it harder
   to knock out patents early in a case, especially when eligibility questions involve
   factual issues that can’t be resolved until later.

Since 
   Alice, alleged infringers have been largely successful in killing patents as ineligible
   either through an initial motion to dismiss or in summary judgment, avoiding a factual
   dispute. 

Patents Directed to ‘Abstract Idea’
The district court and appeals court analyzed only two claims of two out of four Automated
   Tracking patents they found were representative of all the claims.

Coca-Cola told the district court that the asserted patents did not pass the 
   Alice test. For its part, Automated Tracking argued that the patent claims were nonabstract
   as they relate to a particular configuration to collect data from sensors, and electromagnetically
   transmit and analyze it to more accurately and systematically determine the location
   and identity of objects. 

Moreover, the patents specify movement of devices that receive and transmit radio
   signals using specially programmed readers, storage devices, and processors configured
   to perform those functions, it said.

Inventive Concept Lacking
Automated Tracking argued on appeal that its system was invented just as a RFID technology
   was developing. The district court, it said, “erred in resolving a disputed fact question—whether
   the claims recite routine and conventional uses of an RFID system—in Coca-Cola’s favor.”
   

But the Federal Circuit found Automated Tracking’s asserted claims were broad, and
   mentioned uses of RFID system components that were routine and conventional.

“The complaint at issue has no allegations, which when accepted as true, would even
   create a factual issue, and ATS’s specification indicates that the components of the
   claimed invention are conventional,” it said.

Judge Kara F. Stoll wrote the decision, which Judges Evan J. Wallach and Kimberly
   A. Moore joined. Sterne Kessler Goldstein & Fox PLLC represented Automated Tracking
   Solutions. Alston & Bird LLP represented Coca-Cola.

The case is: 
   
   
      Automated Tracking Sols., LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.

Made in China 2025 Initiative at Center of Growing IP Tensions Between United States and China - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/04/23/made-in-china-2025-initiative-ip-tensions/id=95762/,"
EDITOR’S NOTE: I will host a free webinar discussion of navigating the patent monitezation landscape in China on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 12pm EST. Among other things, we will discuss the Made in China 2025 initiative. CLICK HERE to register.
Over the past year, tensions regarding international trade issues between China and the United States have been making a series of news headlines. Such tensions began building last year after the Trump Administration announced probes into deceptive trade practices which were allegedly enforced by the Chinese government, including a probe into the theft of U.S. intellectual property which was launched last August. In early March, President Trump announced tariffs on foreign shipments of steel and aluminum to counter the alleged dumping of Chinese steel into global markets. In early April, President Trump announced additional tariffs of up to $100 billion in part to combat Chinese theft of American IP.
The trade restrictions imposed by the White House in recent days have definitely elicited a strong response from China and the country’s President, Xi Jinping. About one month after the White House announced steel and aluminum tariffs, the Chinese government put into effect tariffs totaling about $3 billion on nearly 130 U.S. products including fruit and pork; China is the world’s largest consumer of pork. About 48 hours after that announcement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced potential additional tariffs which could reach $50 billion, targeting U.S. goods like cars, soybeans and planes. On April 10th, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that China had filed a formal complaint with the international trade regulator over the steel and aluminum tariffs put in place by the U.S.
One of the economic policies put in place by the Chinese government which is coming into more focus as international trade tensions have increased is the country’s Made in China 2025 initiative. Made in China 2025 is a program of the Chinese national government to comprehensively upgrade domestic industries to reach a goal of raising the domestic content of of core components and materials produced in China up to 70 percent by 2025. The Made in China 2025 program identifies 10 key industry sectors to support its domestic goals, including new advanced information technology, aviation, rail, new energy vehicles, agricultural machinery, new materials and biopharma.



A high ranking Chinese official has announced that the Chinese government rejected a request from the United States to end its subsidization of industries identified by the Made in China 2025 initiative. These key industry sectors are areas where technological development is very important and as such, they’ve been at the center of allegations over the forced transfer of patented technologies to Chinese domestic firms as well as outright theft of trade secrets. The Chinese government has responded to concerns over the Made in China initiative with one senior economic official defending the program as open to foreign and private companies according to a report by Hong Kong’s English daily The Standard. 
But Made in China 2025 is not the only Chinese government program in place which aims for technological dominance in important sectors of global industry. Last December, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published guidelines aimed at fostering the development of artificial intelligence to increase the energy efficiency of China’s manufacturing sector by 10 percent by the year 2020. China eventually aims to become the world’s leading AI sector by 2030 with the goal of increasing the value of its domestic AI sector up to nearly $150 billion at that time. China’s AI initiatives are already paying off as an AI market report issued this February showed that AI startup funding in China led the world during 2017, attracting 48 percent of global equity funding for AI startups that year. The United States trailed in second place with 38 percent of global AI startup funding.
The same day that reports about China’s rejection of the United States’ request to end subsidization of Made in China 2025 key industry sectors, The Associated Press reported that China’s President Xi did promise to cut tariffs in the auto industry as well as improve the protection of intellectual property, saying that the country would “protect the lawful ownership rights of foreign enterprises.” Although the AP report indicated that President Xi did not speak to U.S. concerns over forced tech transfer for market access, a scheme which operates in violation of China’s obligations as a member of the WTO, the Chinese leader has shown himself to be very savvy in intellectual property matters, especially over the past year. Last July, President Xi reportedly commented at an important Chinese economic forum on issues surrounding intellectual property infringement, saying that “Wrongdoing should be punished more severely so that IP infringers will pay a heavy price.”
President Xi’s remarks in support of stronger protections have resulted in the shaping of an IP economy which presents almost a photo-negative version of the IP regime developing in the United States, at least where patents are concerned. In recent months, the Chinese government has relaxed the patentability standards for software and business method patents, sectors of innovation which have been disincentivized in America thanks to precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014’s Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. China has also streamlined the examination process for big data, Internet and cloud computing inventions. As a result, China is the leading nation in terms of the number of patent applications being filed by a long shot and it’s helping domestic firms like Huawei build a great deal of corporate value. Conversely, the United States’ patent system has fallen to 12th this year in large part because of the uncertain patentability in sectors like software as well as the patent opposition system enforced at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).
Analysis of President Xi’s more recent comments on protecting intellectual property along with the auto tariff cuts has indicated a belief that those concessions are a step towards diffusing trade tensions with the United States and concerns regarding the Made in China 2025 policy. Xi’s silence on enforced tech transfer, however, speaks volumes given his understanding of the importance of strong patent rights to the national economy. Of course, as long as the United States keeps shooting its foot in terms of patent rights and related policy, China will continue to be the destination for the upcoming generation of new tech development regardless of any joint venture tech transfer rules.

China extends drug patent exclusivity to 25 years - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/05/29/china-extends-drug-patent-exclusivity-25-years/id=97636/,"
On May 11th, the office of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a press release discussing aspects of President Donald Trump’s plans to lower the prices of drugs prescribed to United States citizens. Commissioner Gottlieb noted that the agency was increasing its efforts to implement the Drug Competition Action Plan by removing market barriers to generic pharmaceuticals. The press release also indicated that the agency would be calling out the actions of specific companies it believes are abusing the system “to reduce gaming of statutory and regulatory requirements to help ensure that drug companies don’t use anticompetitive strategies to delay development and approval of important generic drugs.”
Commissioner Gottlieb’s statement cited the agency’s release last June of a list of off-patent, off-exclusivity drugs for which there are no generic equivalents on the market. The FDA’s efforts to get more generic drugs on the market has had a measurable effect on the patent landscape for pharmaceuticals, however. In 2017, the agency approved a record number of applications for generic drugs, marking more than 1,000 full or tentative approvals. This large number of generic drug approvals has resulted in a 60 percent increase in Hatch-Waxman litigation related to abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) for generic versions of patented pharmaceuticals.
Political rhetoric on drug prices has also been ramping up over the past few months in ways that  have further called into question the effects of patents on drug prices. During a November confirmation hearing for the now-Secretary for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Alex Azar, the then-nominee has been quoted in news reports as saying that, in order to lower drug prices paid by Americans, “we have to fight gaming the system of patents and exclusivity by drug companies.” Then this February, the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) issued a report entitled Reforming Biopharmaceutical Pricing at Home and Abroad. While the report was measured in its discussion on patent rights, even noting the effects that healthcare innovations have had on reducing patient costs, it includes data points which could cast a negative light on drug costs associated with patented pharmaceuticals. 
Citing data published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the CEA reported that Americans pay more than 70 percent of patented biopharmaceutical profits among all OECD countries despite only accounting for 34 percent of the OECD’s total gross domestic product (GDP). That certainly could be used as a political talking point by those who are willing to neglect the CEA’s point on the positive effects patented innovations have played in reducing healthcare costs.



Among members of the news media, patents have been a popular whipping boy when contemplating why Americans pay higher drug prices relative to the rest of the world. Last September, business news publication Bloomberg published an article which was highly critical of pharmaceutical developer AbbVie’s patent protection of its arthritis drug Humira. The Bloomberg piece indicated that the thicket of patents covering aspects of Humira has allowed the company to maintain a monopoly over that particular drug even after the core patent expired; the Bloomberg author contemplated that this exclusivity flew in the face of the intentions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Last year, Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) had pushed government agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to exercise march-in rights, which gives the government the right to take action to regulate the licensing of any patents which were funded at least in-part by a governmental agency; coverage of Doggert’s efforts by NPR did not indicate that the NIH or any other agency had exercised these rights.
A spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) issued the following statement on intellectual property and regulations in the pharmaceutical space:
“Strong and predictable intellectual property rights and reliable legal and regulatory frameworks promote innovation and enhance competition; they give innovative pharmaceutical companies powerful incentives to invest in finding tomorrow’s cures and treatments.”
Meanwhile, the Chinese national government extended the period of exclusivity on pharmaceutical patents from 20 years up to 25 years. That extension is reportedly the result of U.S. efforts to address intellectual property violations committed by the Chinese government, but it does mark yet another aspect of patent law where the Chinese and U.S. systems seem to be photo-negatives of each other. For example, uncertainty regarding the patentability of software inventions which has been impacted by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank has led in part to the recent decline of the U.S. patent system in international rankings. By contrast, China has been shoring up the patentability of software inventions by relaxing barriers to software and business method patents and streamlining the examination process for big data and Internet-related patents. The result has been that China is now outpacing the U.S. in startup funding for artificial intelligence, a sector of technology which is heavily reliant on software and will only become increasingly valuable in the years to come.
While China makes moves to embrace further innovation in the pharmaceutical sector by extending exclusivity for drug developers, the United States has evidenced an incredible amount of skepticism regarding the activities of pharmaceutical patent owners trying to protect their property. Nowhere has this been more apparent than with Allergan’s patent deal with the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe last year, which major news outlets have portrayed as an effort by Allergan to “game” the patent system. Allergan’s patents were already the subject of patent invalidity proceedings in U.S. district court but the fact that they dared to pursue a sovereign immunity defense of those patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) (a defense which had previously worked for state universities) has led to great skepticism. Politicians in DC went so far as to call for probes into that particular transaction and introduce a bill in the Senate specifically to abrogate sovereign tribal immunity in inter partes review (IPR) proceedings, as if Native American tribes shouldn’t be involved in tech licensing and should just stick to selling cigarettes and running casinos. All of this continues to tell a story that, if a patent owning entity wants to enjoy actual protections for patented intellectual property, that firm should be doing business in China before ever thinking about entering the U.S. market where they face incredible hurdles in protecting their innovative developments.

Symposium: Business methods as “abstract ideas” - explaining the opacity of Alice and Bilski - SCOTUSblog,http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/06/symposium-business-methods-as-abstract-ideas-explaining-the-opacity-of-alice-and-bilski/,"
Rebecca S. Eisenberg is the Robert & Barbara Luciano Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School
Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank is the fourth in a new wave of opinions from the Supreme Court on the topic of patent-eligible subject matter that began with its 2010 opinion in In re Bilski, and the second of these opinions to consider the patent eligibility of computer-implemented business methods.  This new wave brought to an end a quiet period of almost thirty years in which the Court said very little on the topic, allowing patentable subject matter to expand under the supervision of the Federal Circuit.  Under this expansive approach, the Federal Circuit explicitly rejected a line of lower court decisions, never addressed by the Supreme Court, that categorically excluded business methods from patent protection.

The new opinions purport to revive the more restrictive approach from the Court’s own older decisions, without embracing any other non-statutory exclusions (such as the business methods exclusion).  Four Justices would have endorsed an exclusion of “business methods” from patentable subject matter in Bilski and three Justices would have done so in Alice, but such an exclusion has so far failed to get the support of a majority of the Court.  In both Bilski and Alice, the Justices nonetheless unanimously held that the business method claims before it were not patent eligible, but the only rationale that they could agree on for the exclusion was that the patents improperly claimed ”abstract ideas.” Without embracing a categorical exclusion for all business methods, the Court thus quietly shifted the meaning of the traditional exclusion for “abstract ideas” to provide a basis for invalidating the particular business method patents before it.
The new opinions use familiar language from the Court’s older decisions to affirm traditional exclusions of “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.” The Court also turns to the older decisions to justify the subject matter limitations, explaining that they prevent patenting “basic tools of scientific and technological work” because patenting such discoveries “might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it.”  This looks like a mere affirmation of venerable precedent.
On a closer reading, however, the familiar language in the new opinions appears to mean something quite different from what it meant in the past.  Rather than preventing the patenting of basic tools because they are too important to leave to the exclusive control of a patent holder, the new decisions seem to prevent the patenting of modest variations on longstanding practices that are unworthy of patent protection because they add too little to what is already conventional.  As John Duffy explains in greater detail, patent law has other quality control mechanisms to do this work in a more disciplined fashion, including statutory provisions that define the prior art and standards for determining whether the invention represents a patentable advance from the perspective of others working in the same field.
The new opinions use a two-step test for patentable subject matter.  In the first step, the Court determines whether the claim is directed to a patent-ineligible law of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract idea.  If so, then in the second step the Court asks whether the claim adds enough additional elements (which the Court calls an “inventive concept”) to transform the ineligible subject matter into a patent-eligible invention.  In both steps, the new cases seem to use patentable subject matter doctrine to provide a redundant check on the patenting of prior art.  The Court’s determinations of what counts as an “abstract idea” in the first step have relied upon the prevalence of a practice in the prior art, while in its search for an “inventive concept” in the second step the Court has asked whether the claims add more than conventional activity to an otherwise ineligible law of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract idea.    Although the new cases consider the older precedents at some length in searching for a qualifying “inventive concept” in the second step of the patent eligibility analysis, they are charting new territory in determining what counts as an ineligible “abstract idea” in the first step. The Court’s decision on Thursday holds that “intermediated settlement” – i.e., settlement of a transaction through an intermediary – is an unpatentable abstract idea, relying primarily on the prior decision in Bilski v. Kappos, which held that “risk hedging” is an unpatentable abstract idea. Both decisions emphasize the longstanding prevalence of risk hedging and intermediated settlement to support this characterization, thereby conflating the issue of patent eligibility with the distinct issue of patent worthiness.
Other comments have noted (here and here) that the Court has declined to define the terms “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.”  Nonetheless, the Court’s conclusions that the claims before it in Alice and Bilski recite abstract ideas clearly give that term a broader meaning than it had in the past.  The older decisions applied that term primarily to mathematical algorithms and broadly defined principles, while the new decisions apply it to conventional business practices.  This expansion, although unacknowledged, allowed the Court to disapprove of the claims in both Alice and Bilski under its own longstanding precedents, without adopting the non-statutory business methods exclusion.  (Professor Duffy explains why conservative Justices would hesitate to embrace such a non-statutory standard here.) But it stretched the meaning of “abstract ideas” so far beyond prior usage that the older cases provide little help in discerning what the Court now thinks it means.
Both Bilski  and Alice recite the familiar “basic tools” justification in support of the exclusion, but the justification makes little sense as applied in those cases.  In the older cases, the “basic tools” justification suggests a very different function than preventing the patenting of inventions that represent uninventive variations on longstanding practice.  Instead, the traditional exclusions would deny patents to fundamental breakthrough discoveries that open up new fields of technology.  To cite a favorite judicial example, many opinions have observed in dicta that Einstein could not have patented his celebrated insight that e=mc2.  The problem is not that the insight is trivial or conventional, but rather that it is too important to allow a patent holder to appropriate for exclusive use.
Actual patent claimants who have litigated the boundaries of patentable subject matter are, for the most part, no Einsteins, and their claimed inventions are less compelling examples of “basic tools of scientific and technological work” than a hypothetical claim to e=mc2.  Nonetheless, the Court has relied on the same “basic tools” rationale for excluding more modest advances from patentable subject matter.  In its 2012 decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, the Court concluded that the claims before it recited patent-ineligible “laws of nature,” although they were “narrow laws that may have limited applications.”  While recognizing that “[a] patent on a narrow law of nature may not inhibit future research as seriously as would a patent upon Einstein’s law of relativity,” the Court claimed a lack of institutional competence in refusing to distinguish among laws of nature according to their breadth, noting that prior cases have instead “endorsed a bright line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas, and the like, which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying ‘building-block’ concern.”
The “building-block” concern is harder to explain for patents on computer-implemented business methods, such as the patents in Bilski and Alice.  The lower court decisions that held business methods ineligible for patent protection did not attempt to shoehorn them into the Supreme Court’s exclusions for “laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas,” and did not argue that they were “basic tools of scientific and technological work.”
The Court invokes the traditional concern with preempting “the basic tools of scientific and technological work” in Alice and Bilski, but it has adapted its articulation somewhat to broaden the justification to fit business method patents, for example, by substituting the more general phrases “building blocks of human ingenuity” and “building block of the modern economy.”  To explain why risk-hedging and settlement intermediation should count as basic building blocks, the Court stresses their important role in the prior art, noting that each is “a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce.”
While these decisions purport to return to the law established in prior cases, they are in fact making a new move that leaves lower courts and litigants struggling to figure out what the Court means by “abstract ideas.”  As long as this uncertainty continues, some litigants will inevitably seek Supreme Court review in the hope of a more favorable decision on patent eligibility than they got from the Federal Circuit.  Perhaps the Court will welcome this opportunity to police the subject matter boundaries of the patent system on a case-by-case basis, but if it would prefer to avoid that role, it needs to provide clearer guidance to allow others to discern where those boundaries lie.

Happy Birthday Alice: Two Years Busting Bad Software Patents






This week marks the second anniversary of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Alice v. CLS Bank. In Alice, the court ruled that an abstract idea does not become eligible for a patent simply by being implemented on a generic computer. When the case was decided, we wrote that it would be a few years until we knew its true impact. Two years in, we can say that while Alice has not solved all problems with software patents, it has given productive companies a valuable tool for fighting back against patent trolls. And while it has been bad for the trolls, there’s little reason to think the Alice decision harmed real software companies.
When Alice was being argued, many supporters of software patents claimed that weakening software patents would harm the industry. For example, Judge Moore of the Federal Circuit argued (PDF) that invalidating all of the patent claims at issue would “would decimate the electronics and software industries.” Others made similar claims after the Supreme Court’s decision.
How did the doomsayers fare? Well, those who that thought Alice would “decimate” the software industry might want to try to rent an apartment in San Francisco right now. Demand for software engineers remains extremely strong. And software companies, including many with large patent portfolios, have generally done fine. In fact, if you had invested in a software ETF the day after Alice you would have handily beat the market. This isn’t to say that Alice is the reason the industry is thriving, but it is a reminder that software patents and the software industry are not the same thing.
While companies that actually write software and employ people are doing fine, Alice has put a dent in the business model of bottom-feeding trolls. Specifically, it has provided a valuable tool for getting abstract software patents thrown out early in litigation. This makes it harder for trolls to leverage the cost of defending a lawsuit and lets startups and other productive companies get on with the business of innovating. Consider these examples:
eDekka: The most litigious troll of 2014 had 168 cases thrown out when a judge found patent claims on storing and labeling information invalid under Alice.
Eclipse IP LLC: Another prolific patent troll had claims from multiple patents (on computer-based notification systems) ruled invalid under Alice. We later awarded a similar Eclipse patent our Stupid Patent of the Month award for April 2015. (Note that Eclipse IP LLC subsequently changed its name to Electronic Communication Technologies LLC.)
Garfum.com Corporation: EFF helped a photographer fight back against a company claiming to own the idea of having a vote-for-your-favorite photo competition. The patent owner dismissed its case rather than face a ruling on the merits under Alice.
White Knuckle: This patent on remotely updating sports video games was our Stupid Patent of the Month in January 2015. On June 2, 2016, a federal judge ruled that since remotely updating software was already conventional when the application was filed, the patent’s claims (which included things like updating the grass at a virtual stadium) were invalid.
Alice has not solved all problems with the patent system. But without the ruling, it is likely that these cases others like them would have dragged on until the defendant was effectively forced to settle. Two years in, we can celebrate Alice as a qualified success. We’ll keep working to ensure that the ruling is applied diligently and for more fundamental patent reform to protect innovators.

Blockchain: What Is It And Can I Protect It Via Patents? - Intellectual Property - United States,http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/724454/Patent/Blockchain+What+Is+It+And+Can+I+Protect+It+Via+Patents,"What is Blockchain?
Blockchain technology, some might argue, is the most important
technological innovation since the Internet. Those impacted by this
technology are not only companies, but also everyday people. Thus,
everyone should try to have a basic understanding of what
blockchain is, and how one might benefit from it.
The inventor of the blockchain technology is a person or group
of people known by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. Blockchain was
originally devised for cryptocurrency (e.g. bitcoins), but is now
evolving into other areas including real estate, health care,
insurance, and more.
In simple terms, blockchain is a distributed database containing
a list of transactions, also referred to as a distributed ledger.
The list of transactions is unique to a particular individual.
Information about the transactions is maintained in blocks that are
chained together in sequential order, thereby creating a blockchain
for those transactions. Once created, the blockchains are stored in
millions of computing nodes networked to each other in a
peer-to-peer network. This differs from ledgers that are maintained
by banks in a central database. The lack of a central database for
blockchain technology means no single point of failure, and no
single place where hackers can access it to corrupt the database.
This allows blockchains to remain secure.
Each computer in the peer-to-peer network maintains a copy of an
entire blockchain. The information stored in each block of the
blockchain may include details about a transaction, such as data on
the sender, receiver, and amount of coins transferred. When a new
transaction occurs, a new block is created. New blocks are created
by people referred to as ""miners"" who receive an economic
incentive to create the new blocks. Once created, a new block is
sent to all the nodes in the network for verification that the
block has not been tampered with. If verification is successful,
each node adds the new block to its copy of the blockchain. Once
added, the block cannot be removed making blockchains
irreversible.
In addition to information about a particular transaction, each
block stores three other sets of information: 1) a hash of the
block; 2) a hash of the previous block; and 3) proof of work. A
hash is a value that identifies the block and the contents of that
block. Much like a fingerprint, the hash value is unique to the
block. If the contents of the block changes, so does the hash
value. Hash values, therefore, help detect any attempt by hackers
to make changes to the block.
Another piece of data that is stored in each block of the
blockchain is the hash of the previous block. The fact that each
block must not only store its own hash but the hash of the previous
block, is effectively what creates the chain of blocks. This is
also a major reason why blockchains are secure. If a hacker does
tamper with one block, causing a new hash to be created, the hash
of all following blocks in the chain must also be recomputed in
order for those blocks to be valid.
The last piece of data stored in a block, the proof of work, is
a mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks. It is a
mechanism utilized by the miners to verify that transactions within
each block are legitimate. In order to do so, miners solve a puzzle
known as a proof-of-work problem. A reward is given to the first
miner that solves each block's problem, thereby verifying that
the block is legitimate.
As an example of how blockchains might be created and used,
let's assume that there are three people who want to move money
from one to another. At the inception of the network, A has 10
coins. Thus, the first block of the blockchain contains this
information: A = 10 as well as a hash value for the block. Now, A
wants to move 5 coins to B. Because A has 10 coins, the transaction
is valid. Thus, a second block is created for the new transaction,
and the second block is linked to the first block by not only
storing the hash value of its own block, but the hash value of the
previous block.
Now, let's say that B wants to move 15 coins to A. This
transaction is not valid since B does not have 15 coins.Thus, the
new transaction is not verified, and is not added to the
blockchain.
Patent Protection for Innovotions Relating to Blockchain
The increasing popularity of blockchain technology has also
increased the number of patent applications for innovations related
to this technology. So far, over 740 blockchain patent applications
have published worldwide, a dramatic increase since 2016.
Although many applications have been filed for
blockchain-related innovations, getting a patent in this area may
be far from smooth sailing, especially in light of the 2014 Supreme
Court decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 134
S. Ct. 2347 (2014). The court in Alice held that claims
directed to mitigating ""settlement risk"" (i.e. risk that
only one party to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy
its obligation) was a patent-ineligible abstract idea under Section
101 of the Patent Act. In a similar manner, a patent examiner might
conclude that innovations surrounding blockchains are
patent-ineligible abstract ideas. Such rejections might have merit
under the current state of the law if the invention utilizing
blockchain technology merely seeks to protect a fundamental
economic practice, protect a method of managing relationships or
transactions between people, or is merely directed to organizing or
analyzing information in a way that could all be performed
mentally.
Knowing that potential hurdles might exist under Section 101 of
the Patent Act should prompt patent applicants to draft their
patent applications in a manner that maximizes the chances of
overcoming or avoiding a rejection under this section. In doing so,
applicants may turn to guidance provided by the courts and by the
Patent Office itself. For example, both the Patent Office and the
Federal Circuit have acknowledged that innovations that are aimed
at bringing technical improvements are patent-eligible. The
technical improvements may be the functioning of the computer
itself, or improvements to another technology or technical
field.
One useful case to consider is Bascom Glob. Internet Servs.,
Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341 (2016). The
claims at issue in that case were directed to a system and method
for filtering Internet content. The Federal Circuit agreed that
filtering content is an abstract idea because it is a
long-standing, well-known method of organizing human behavior. The
Federal Circuit also agreed that the limitations of the claims,
taken individually, recited generic computer, network, and internet
components, none of which was inventive by itself. However, the
Federal Circuit concluded that the combination of the claimed
elements amounted to significantly more than the abstract idea
because of the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of
those elements that provided a technical improvement in the art.
BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC,
827 F.3d 1341, 1350-51 (2016).
Another case to consider is DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com,
L.P., 773 F.3d 1245, 1258-59, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1106-07 (Fed.
Cir. 2014). The invention that was patented in that case addressed
a business challenge (retaining website visitors), which was
particular to the internet. The court found that the claimed
invention differed from other claims found by courts to recite
abstract ideas because the claimed invention did not ""merely
recite the performance of some business practice known from the
pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform it on the
Internet."" (Id at 1257.) Instead, the claimed
solution was ""necessarily rooted in computer technology in
order to overcome a problem specifically arising in the realm of
computer network."" (Id.)
As in Bascom and DDR, if a blockchain-related
invention provides a technical improvement to a technical problem,
such an invention should be deemed to be patent eligible. For
example, the invention might provide a solution to a technical
problem or a deficiency introduced to the computing system due to
the use of blockchain technology. If the solution provides
improvements to the functioning of the computing system itself,
such an invention should be deemed to be patent eligible. The
technical solution, however, should be described with particularity
in the patent application. The more general the description of the
solution/invention, the higher the likelihood that it may be deemed
to be an abstract idea.
The technical solution provided by the invention need not,
however, necessarily be one that improves the functioning of a
computer itself in order to be patent-eligible. The solution might
be one that provides improvements to some other technology or
technical field. For example, if a blockchain-related invention
does not improve the functioning of the computer itself, but
rather, brings improvements to technologies such as
encoding/decoding technologies, error correction technologies,
digital transmission/download technologies, data compression
technologies, or technologies integral to the internet, then the
invention should not be deemed to be merely a patent ineligible
abstract idea.
In summary, blockchain technology has opened the door to a new
way of engaging in transactions that might be deemed to be
revolutionary by many. Further innovations surrounding this
technology are anticipated, and patent applications might be
desired for many of those innovations. Under the current state of
the law, however, there might be obstacles in obtaining patents for
those innovations. Understanding what the obstacles might be, and
carefully crafting patent applications to increase the likelihood
of overcoming such obstacles, will allow applicants to maximize
their chances of obtaining patents for their inventions.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general
guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought

"Patenting Artificial Intelligence: Issues Of Obviousness, Inventorship, And Patent Eligibility - Intellectual Property - United States",http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/726228/Patent/Patenting+Artificial+Intelligence+Issues+Of+Obviousness+Inventorship+And+Patent+Eligibility,"Artificial intelligence (""AI"") is rapidly transforming
the world of medicine, as the recent decades have marked a surge in
the development of medical AI.1 These thinking machines
are now used in diagnosis, treatment, and drug development. As the
technology advances, so too must our understanding of patent law
and patent protection. The use of AI in these fields raises several
issues, all hinging on the question of personhood and human
contributions, affecting both inventorship (and ownership) and
patentability (including subject matter eligibility and
predictability). This article addresses these questions in turn
after addressing the recent advances in medical AI.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
AI techniques utilized in medicine include artificial neural
networks, fuzzy expert systems, evolutionary computation, and
hybrid intelligent systems.2
Artificial neural networks are used extensively in clinical
diagnosis and image analysis because of the parallel processing
power that allows the networks to learn from historical examples
and known patterns.3 Artificial neural networks have
been used for diagnosing prostates as benign or malignant, cervical
screening, and imaging analysis (including radiographs,
ultrasounds, CTs, and MRIs), as well as for analyzing heart
waveforms to diagnose conditions such as atrial fibrillation and
ventricular arrhythmias.4
For example, researchers at Stanford University trained a deep
convolutional neural network to classify skin lesions into either
benign or malignant groupings based on known images, using only
pixels and disease labels as inputs.5 The researchers
started with an algorithm developed by Google to perform image
recognition6 and then trained their neural network to
recognize skin cancer using 129,450 clinical images of 2,032
different diseases.7 The neural network was then tested
against board-certified dermatologists on clinical images that had
been confirmed through biopsy.8 The AI performed on par
with the certified dermatologists, demonstrating that the AI was
capable of classifying skin cancer with the same level of
competence as the trained dermatologists.9
As yet another example, medical chatbots utilize neural networks
to learn from medical textbooks, scientific research, patient
records, and messages between actual patients and
doctors.10 The AI chatbot is constantly learning and can
be kept up to date on the latest medical research.11
Baidu, a Chinese search engine, utilizes a chatbot named Melody
within its Baidu Doctor app.12 When a patient asks a
question to the doctor, the chatbot asks appropriate follow-up
questions to help learn more about the patient's symptoms so
the doctor can make a more informed decision on
treatment.13 Interventional radiologists at the
University of California at Los Angeles have developed a chatbot to
assist physicians in providing real-time evidence-based answers to
the patient about the next phase of treatment, or information about
their interventional radiology treatment.14
Fuzzy logic AI is applicable in medicine because diseases,
symptoms, and diagnoses are described in imprecise and
terms.15 Because fuzzy logic rests on the premise that
everything is a matter of degree, it can recognize ""partial
truth logics,"" beyond just the true and false values applied
in traditional programming.16 Fuzzy logic AI has been
applied to cancer diagnosis for lung cancer, acute leukemia, breast
cancer, and pancreatic cancer.17 Fuzzy logic has been
applied to diagnosis of other conditions, including tuberculosis,
aphasia, arthritis, and hypothyroidism.18
""Evolutionary computation is the general term for several
computational techniques based on natural evolution process that
imitates the mechanism of natural selection and survival of the
fittest in solving real-world problems.""19 Genetic
algorithms are the most widely used form of evolutionary
computation in medicine, creating numerous solutions to a single
problem, and then evolving those solutions from one generation to
the next to arrive at the best solution.20 Evolutionary
computation has been used in diagnosis, prognosis, imaging, and
signal processing.21
Combining these AI techniques generates hybrid intelligent
systems that incorporate the advantages of each
technology.22 For example, the combination of neural
networks and fuzzy logic or ""neuro-fuzzy"" systems have
become popular because they can absorb some of the
""noise"" generally present in the neural
network.23
Uncertainties in Patenting AI—Subject Matter
Eligibility
As the use of AI in medicine becomes ever more prevalent, the
patent system must answer increasingly difficult questions
regarding the protection afforded these technologies. Perhaps the
most significant question is that of subject matter eligibility.
With the Supreme Court decisions in Alice and Mayo, the hurdle to
meet subject matter eligibility has grown ever
higher.24
Subject matter eligibility is one of the core criteria for
receiving a patent, in addition to novelty and nonobviousness. An
invention must contain patent-eligible subject matter in order to
receive patent protection. 35 U.S.C. § 101 states that
""[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and
useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a
patent therefor."" Abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural
phenomena are excluded from patentable subject matter.25
The U.S. Supreme Court has further enunciated the requirement for
subject matter eligibility, ultimately laying out a two-part test
that must be met by any claimed invention.
In Mayo, the Supreme Court invalidated issued patent claims
directed to the relationship between the concentrations of certain
metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a drug dosage
would prove ineffective or cause harm for failing to meet this
requirement.26 The Supreme Court held that the claims
were not subject matter eligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101
because the claims provided ""instructions [that] add nothing
specific to the laws of nature other than what is well-understood,
routine, conventional activity, previously engaged in by those in
the field.""27 According to the Court, the dosage
limits at which a drug would prove ineffective or cause harm was a
law of nature that was unpatentable, and the claims merely
instructed doctors to apply this law of nature using techniques
that were already known.
Alice addressed the holding in Mayo, further enunciating a
two-step test for subject matter patent eligibility: (1) 
determine whether the claims are directed to a patent-ineligible
concept (laws of nature, abstract ideas, and natural phenomena);
and (2) determine whether the claim's elements, considered
both individually and as an ordered combination, transform the
nature of the claims into a patent-eligible
application.28 If a claim is directed to a patent in
eligible concept and the claim's elements do not transform the
nature of the claim, then it will fail to meet § 101.
These two Supreme Court cases present a hurdle that medical AI
inventions will have to overcome in order to receive patent
protection. Current AI medical device/system patents can be
directed to both the methods and apparatuses that perform the above
described analyses. Many AI medical patents are directed to the AI
algorithms and the machines used to generate those
algorithms.29 As described above, AI has been found to
be extremely successful in diagnosis and prognosis, relating known
images to new cases and extrapolating based on the similarities or
differences between the two. In some instances, this is the same
process followed by a doctor or medical expert, just with greater
efficiency or accuracy. The steps for diagnosis struck down in Mayo
echo the steps taken in many medical AI algorithms. Practitioners
and inventors alike will need to carefully consider the full scope
of eligible subject matter in order to ensure that a patent can be
obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
(""PTO"") and maintained through any subsequent
challenges.
Indeed, the Federal Circuit has already found revolutionary
diagnostic technology to be patent-ineligible subject matter under
the Mayo/Alice framework. In Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom,
Inc., the court concluded that a novel method of prenatal diagnosis
of fetal DNA was not directed to patent-eligible subject matter,
despite agreeing that the claimed method ""reflects a
significant human contribution . . . that revolutionized prenatal
care.""30 The patent claims were generally directed
to detecting the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal
plasma. Because the presence of cell-free fetal DNA was a natural
phenomenon, the court turned to the second step in the Mayo/Alice
framework—whether the claim contained an inventive concept
sufficient to transform the naturally occurring phenomenon into
patent-eligible subject matter.31 The court found that
the second step was not met because the method steps ""were
well-understood, conventional, and routine,"" despite
acknowledging their breakthrough nature.32
More recently, the Federal Circuit found methods for detecting
myeloperoxidase (""MPO"") in blood, and correlating the
results to cardiovascular risk, to be directed to patent-ineligible
subject matter in Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health
Diagnostics LLC. 33 Although Cleveland Clinic argued
that the discovery of the correlation was groundbreaking, the
Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that the
correlation between MPO levels in blood and cardiovascular disease
was a law of nature.34 The court noted that Cleveland
Clinic had not invented any new and useful laboratory technique to
detect MPO levels.35 In the second step, the court found
the claims applied well-known techniques to determine the level of
MPO and applied established statistical methods to make the
correlation.36
Although the Supreme Court cautioned against construing the
exclusionary principle of § 101 overbroadly, ""lest it
swallow all of patent law,""37 many believe it has
done just that in the life sciences and medical
spaces.38 The concurring opinion in Ariosa echoed these
concerns, stating that ""[b]ut for the sweeping language in the
Supreme Court's Mayo opinion, [there was] no reason, in policy
or statute, why this breakthrough invention should be deemed patent
ineligible.""39 The same reasoning could well
curtail the patent protections afforded medical AI absent a change
in Supreme Court precedent or statute. Until such a change occurs,
AI inventors and owners must draft their patents with an eye to
this two-step test, including features related to the AI in the
claims, such as detailing the computing or mathematical techniques
applied by the system or describing how the computer interacts with
other components to drive the AI processing.

Why Alice v. CLS Bank is a Victory for Software Patents - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/02/06/alice-v-cls-bank-is-a-victory-for-software-patents/id=54489/,"
I have been asked for my opinion based my long history in the software industry and from my perspective as someone that has followed that controversial question “Is Software patentable”? That question first began to be publicly debated when I received the first software patent in 1968 for an invention on a new way of sorting data on a computer. Shortly thereafter a publication printed a page one headline “First Patent is Issued for Software, Full Implications Are Not Yet Known.”
Forty five years later a variation of that question was again before the Supreme Court when it agreed to hear the appeal of the Alice v. CLS Bank case. On December 6, 2013 the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the following question that was framed by Alice:
“Whether claims to computer-implemented inventions—including claims to systems and machines, processes, and items of manufacture—are directed to patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 101 as interpreted by this Court?”
But in the oral arguments on March 3, 2014 and in the Court’s 9 to 0 decision on June 19th that question was never directly answered. Indirectly they answered “yes” when they wrote that “inventive concepts” are the basis for a patent. And the Patent Office expanded on “inventive concepts” when they issued their Preliminary Examination of the Alice Decision on June 25, 2014. The Patent Office first stated: “Notably, Alice Corp. neither creates a per se excluded category of subject matter, such as software or business methods, nor imposes any special requirements for eligibility of software or business methods.” They went on to state that “improvements to another technology or technical field” and” improvements to the functioning of the computer itself” were examples of patentable subject matter.
 
Based on the Supreme Court decision and the Patent Office guidelines it is clear to me that the Alice Supreme Court decision is a major victory for patenting computer-implemented (software) inventions.
But when one reads the very many lower Court decisions since the Alice decision, the many negative articles by some IP lawyers and the press, one might believe that I am living in a fantasy world.
It is true that since the Alice decision the lower courts set a new record for rejecting software patents and the press wrote that “Courts have recently grown increasingly hostile to software patents” (see The Courts Set a New Record for Rejecting Software Patents in 2014). But that’s a good omen because of the many, many obvious patent applications that should have never been approved by the Patent office.
Prior to the June 19, 2014, Alice v. CLS Bank Supreme Court decision I published three articles in IPWatchdog giving my views on this important Supreme Court case. In those articles I believe many of my arguments were represented in the amicus briefs that were provided by the many companies that had a stake in the outcome of the case.
Below is a summary of those articles which contain many of the factual arguments that I believe the Supreme Court considered when it made its historic 8 to 0 decision.
 
Article 1: In my January 21, 2014 article Why the Supreme Court in the CLS Bank v. Alice Case Should Not Answer the Question on Computer-Implemented Invention (which was an open letter to the Supreme Court), I argued that just because software is mentioned (or described) in the Specification section of the patent application it should in no way be the basis for accepting or rejecting a patent application. I went on to discuss the equivalence of computer software and hardware circuits and referenced the article Hardware/Software Tradeoffs: A General Design Principle? That article stated that the decision to put certain features in hardware and others in software is based on such factors as cost, speed, reliability and frequency of change. The abstract of the article concluded with the statement “Today’s software is tomorrow’s hardware, and vice versa.”
I argued that a better question before the Supreme Court would have been…
“Is an invention that is patentable when specified in hardware, equally patentable when specified in software?”
I argued that true inventions — whether specified in hardware, software, solar power, gears, or what have you — must stand on their own two feet and meet the test of an invention as specified in the US Patent law. And that the USPTO states that an invention is defined in its claims and not by its specification. (See Determine What is an Invention).
I suggested that the Supreme Court should find a way to distinguish “true inventions” from those very questionable inventions (like Amazon’s one-click patent), and I gave four examples that could be classified as computer-implemented inventions. They were: An Artificial Retina invention; A Voice and Speech Recognition invention; A Reading Machine for the Blind invention; and my 1968 Sorting System invention.
I concluded that the Supreme Court should simply affirm, as it has in the past, that including software in the Specification (formally called the Disclosure) Section of a patent application is perfectly permissible. (In1981 in the Diamond v Diehr Supreme Court decision they stated —“… the mere presence of a software element did not make an otherwise patent-eligible machine or process un-patentable.”)
 
Article 2: In my March 20, 2014 article Misnomers, Myths, Misunderstandings and Misconceptions about Software Patents” I first explain why the term “Software is a misnomer and that there is a good reason why there is no legal definition of a software patent. I then looked closely at the Artificial Retina (Visual Prosthesis) invention which I described in my first article. That patent description included a pair of glasses attached to a video camera unit, a computer and software. If one looks at the Claims and Specifications in the issued patent there are 12 claims and there is never a mention of software or a computer program. Most of the specification discusses how the information from a video camera is transformed into signals that are transmitted wirelessly to a receiver that is surgically implanted in and around the eye
I argued that one would be hard pressed to call the Artificial Retina patent a software patent and that many medical device and prosthesis inventions have the potential of losing their patent protections with an adverse decision from the Supreme Court.
I then covered the myth that software is mathematics, a mental process, laws of nature or abstract. I referred to Wikipedia which gives a solid definition of software and that the words “mathematics, mental process, laws of nature and abstract” never appear in its description. I then explained why software is not a law of nature or abstract any more than a computer circuit or computer chip is. In reviewing the six phases in the software product development life cycle I explained why software products are very much like any other manufactured product.
I continued the article by reviewing a common misconception that copyright protection can substitute for patent protection. Patents protect an inventive machine process, while copyrights do not. And that under patent law, only inventions can be patented — not software or computer programs.
I concluded the article debunking the common misconception that software has a short lifespan and that therefore software companies are not in need of patent protection. My article gives statistics about the Software Products and Services Industry and explains that many software products are in the high-technology category and their marketability is greater than the 18 years of patent protection.
 
Article 3: The third article on May 6, 2014 was Why E-mail & Word Processing Were Not Computer-Implemented Inventions: A Response to Alice v CLS Bank Oral Arguments. During the one hour Supreme Court oral arguments there were many references to e-mail and word processing programs and there was the general belief that sometime in the past both word processing and e-mail were inventions which deserved patent protection.
I wrote that article because my previous company, Applied Data Research (ADR) had developed and marketed both a word processing product and an e-mail product in the 1970’s and 80’s and never applied for a patent. ADR first developed a word processor for in-house use for developing manuals for its products. Later on they developed an e-mail system for their in-house use because ADR had expanded to eleven domestic offices and the offices were networked together through leased lines. The ADR development staff then expanded their word processing program so that they could replace their domestic TWX machines (which were tied to the leased lines) with a system for electronic mail transmission using IBM 3270 terminals.
The purpose of this third article was to give an example of how a company can go from an idea to a successful product without inventing anything. I asked the question… Did the ADR developers invent anything and was ADR remiss in not seeking patent protection? I believe they were not since the implementations of those ideas were obvious.
I concluded the article on a discussion of ideas and abstract ideas. Are they one and the same? I ended the article by stating there are many professionals, in and out of the legal profession, that believe that separating “ideas” from” abstractions” is only a play on words (see The Paradox Of “Abstract Ideas”).
 
So where are we today: When one reads some of the headlines of articles and text that have been published recently, like the Wall Street Journal article entitled “Hard Times for Software Patents,” it can confuse the general public. It was only hard times for those thousands of patents that were abstract and/or obvious and where there was no inventive concept.
The Alice v CLS Bank Supreme Court decision in June 2014 was a great victory for those that believe that inventors that use a digital computer to innovate can get a patent on their invention. It is also a victory for those people and organizations that recognize how the patent System has been abused for many years by trolls and others where there was no invention. Since the Supreme Court decision in June, thousands of patents that should never have been issued are now being deemed invalid by the US Courts and by the Patent Office.
The Patent Office has given its patent examiners and the world a template on how to decide if there is a patentable invention through a two-step analysis (see USPTO Letter to Patent Examiners). Computer-Implemented inventions are becoming more and more important. In the article Top 10 Patents for 2014, an analysis of those patents showed that 6 of the 10 could be classified as computer-implemented inventions.
As David Kappos, the former head of the Patent office concluded in his article Supreme Court leaves patent protection for software innovation intact…
“it is clear that maintaining appropriate incentives and protections for software-based technological advancement is critical to innovation in every sector of the U.S. economy. We are living in the Age of Software, as the Supreme Court’s decision in Alice Corp. bears testament.”
Under the US Patent System that was enacted in 1790 one gets a patent only on inventions. When the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the critical issue is whether there is an inventive concept (and not on how an invention is implemented) the Supreme Court finally ended the debate on whether computer-implemented inventions are patentable.

"In an Abstract Idea Context, Little Within Bright-line Eligibility Prohibition",http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/08/14/abstract-idea-context-little-within-bright-line-eligibility-prohibition/id=100187/,"
“[I]t seems clear that the Supreme Court did not intend to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea…”

This is part two of a three-part article suggesting that the Supreme Court’s “standard approach of construing a statutory exception narrowly to preserve the primary operation of the general rule,” Commissioner v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 727 (1989), should be applied to narrowly construe the implicit statutory exception to 35 U.S.C. § 101 for abstract ideas.
 
In part one of this article I noted that “cases have endorsed a bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas and the like, which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying ‘building-block’ concern,” Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 88-89, 132 S.Ct. 1289, 1303 (2012).  Part one suggested that this bright-line prohibition should be narrowly construed, and that it would be reasonable to only apply the Alice/Mayo two-step framework implementing this bright-line prohibition for concepts that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit,” Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 493 (1945), of the bright-line prohibition.
Part two of this article notes that the bright-line eligibility prohibition was not intended to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea at some level, and suggests that, with respect to an abstract ideas eligibility exception, the only things that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit”, Phillips, 324 U.S. at 493, of this bright-line prohibition are mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent.
 
The bright-line eligibility prohibition was not intended to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea at some level.
Although the Court has not fully defined exactly what does fall within the abstract ideas eligibility exception, what does seem clear from the Court’s jurisprudence is that the Court’s “bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas and the like,” Mayo, 566 U.S. at 89, 132 S.Ct. at 1303, is not intended to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea at some level.
As a first matter, categorically prohibiting patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea at some level would risk this “exclusionary principle … swallow[ing] all of patent law,” Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S.Ct. 2347, 2354 (2014), exactly as the Supreme Court warned against.
This is the case because any idea can be characterized as abstract at some level, and it is well established that every invention is a conceived idea.  On this latter point, the Supreme Court has unequivocably held that “[t]he primary meaning of the word ‘invention’ in the Patent Act unquestionably refers to the inventor’s conception rather than to a physical embodiment of that idea.” Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 60 (1998).  This is neither a new development nor an isolated case, as the Court made clear a century earlier that “[i]n every case the idea conceived is the invention.” Gill v. United States, 160 U.S. 426, 434 (1896).
Because every invention is itself a conceived idea which can be characterized as abstract at some level, every invention can in theory be characterized as an abstract idea at some level.  Thus, interpreting the abstract ideas eligibility exception as categorically barring patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea at some level would create the exact slippery slope that the Supreme Court warned against in its recent eligibility jurisprudence.
Moreover, it seems clear that the Supreme Court did not intend to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea at some level because the Court indicated that there are at least some abstract ideas that are sufficient to confer patent eligibility: namely, inventive concepts.  The Court’s bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature and mathematical formulas clearly was not intended to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea because such a bright-line extension would bar patenting of inventive concepts, which by definition are capable of characterization as abstract ideas but which the Court explicitly acknowledged are sufficient to signal eligibility.
In this regard, the very first entry in the Oxford English Dictionary for “concept” defines it as “An abstract idea”. Oxford English Dictionary, “concept”, https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/concept.  Even though every inventive concept by definition could theoretically be characterized as an abstract idea, it is clear from Supreme Court eligibility jurisprudence that an inventive concept is sufficient to confer patent eligibility on a claim directed to an abstract idea.  In this regard, an inventive concept may be thought of as an abstract idea that can properly be preempted by a patent claim.  This is consistent with the notion of an invention as an idea, as a patent claim to an invention is inherently preemptive of the idea representing the invention.
Currently, though, Supreme Court eligibility jurisprudence offers very little guidance on distinguishing a patent-ineligible abstract idea which cannot properly be preempted by a patent claim from an inventive concept sufficient to confer patent eligibility which can properly be preempted by a patent claim.
For example, as referenced in part one, in characterizing the second step of the Alice/Mayo test, the Court indicated that “we have described step two of this analysis as a search for an ‘inventive concept’ — i.e., an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.” Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2355 (internal quotations and alterations omitted).  In making this statement, the Court was quoting its own statement in Mayo (in a law of nature context) regarding the search for “an ‘inventive concept[]’ sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself.” Mayo, 566 U.S. at 72-73, 132 S.Ct. at 1294.
Applying this approach in an abstract ideas context creates a unique issue not present in a law of nature context, however: while it is generally easy to differentiate between an inventive concept and a law of nature, it is often possible for an inventive concept to itself be characterized as an abstract idea.  The Court in Alice specifically contrasted the “search for an ‘inventive concept’” with “the ineligible concept itself,” Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2355 (internal quotations and alterations omitted), but the Court has not yet had the occasion to offer additional guidance on distinguishing an inventive concept from an ineligible concept.
While this lack of guidance is problematic to attempts to determine whether a particular concept is an ineligible abstract idea or an inventive concept which signals patent eligibility, the Court’s recognition that an inventive concept can signal patent eligibility signals that the Court did not intend its “bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas and the like,” Mayo, 566 U.S. at 89, 132 S.Ct. at 1303, to categorically bar patenting of everything which can theoretically be characterized as an abstract idea at some level.
 
In an abstract ideas context, there is little that has been indicated to be plainly and unmistakably within the terms and spirit of the bright-line prohibition.
Because the Court’s “bright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature, mathematical formulas and the like,” Id., was not intended to categorically prohibit patenting of everything which can be characterized as an abstract idea, it is necessary in each case to determine whether a particular concept that a claim is alleged to be directed to is intended to fall within this bright-line prohibition.
As outlined in part one, the implicit statutory exception for abstract ideas should be construed “narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,” Clark, 489 U.S. at 739 (citing Phillips, 324 U.S. at 493), as to do otherwise would risk “frustrat[ing] the announced will of the people.” Phillips, 324 U.S. at 493.  Given that such a narrow construction is necessary for the implicit judicial exception itself (for “patents that claim the ‘buildin[g] block[s]’ of human ingenuity,” Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2355 (citing Mayo, 566 U.S. at 89, 132 S.Ct. at 1303; Mayo, 566 U.S. at 72, 132 S.Ct. at 1294)), one must be even more careful in construing the “bright-line prohibition … which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying ‘building-block’ concern.” Mayo, 566 U.S. at 89, 132 S.Ct. at 1303.
Analogously to Phillips, there is an argument that “[t]o extend [such a bright-line prohibition] to other than those [concepts] plainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit is to abuse the interpretative process and to frustrate the announced will of the people.” Phillips, 324 U.S. at 493.
Here, one result of the Supreme Court’s very reasonable choice to decline to “labor to delimit the precise contours of the ‘abstract ideas’ category,” Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2357, is that there are only a limited number of concepts which it is clear are “plainly and unmistakably within [the] terms and spirit,” Phillips, 324 U.S. at 493, of this bright-line prohibition.  In particular, in an abstract ideas context, arguably the only things that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit,” Id., of this bright-line prohibition are mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent.
As to the first of these, as noted above, the Supreme Court has clearly “endorsed a bright-line prohibition against patenting … mathematical formulas …, which serves as a somewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying ‘building-block’ concern.” Mayo, 566 U.S. at 89, 132 S.Ct. at 1303.
For example, with respect to mathematical formulas, in Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978), the Court held that where “[a] formula is the only novel feature of [a] method,” “the discovery of this feature [does not] make[] an otherwise conventional method eligible for patent protection.” Flook, 437 U.S. at 588.  Likewise, in Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972), the Court indicated that “[t]he mathematical formula involved here has no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer, which means that if the judgment below is affirmed, the patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula.” Benson, 409 U.S. at 71-72.
Similarly, with respect to fundamental practices that are long prevalent, in Alice, the Court found “a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce” to lie within its bright-line prohibition, and applied the test it had articulated in Mayo to find claims ineligible. Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2350; see also Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010). (The Supreme Court has only specifically indicated the ineligibility of fundamental economic practices that are long prevalent, but for purposes of this article, it is assumed arguendo that the broader, genericized formulation of “fundamental practices that are long prevalent” can be utilized. Arguably, there is no real need to employ an eligibility exception for fundamental practices that are long prevalent, as it seems like a claim directed to such a concept (absent an additional inventive concept), would clearly be unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 102 as lacking novelty or under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as obvious.)
None of this is intended to suggest that there is any sort of “talismanic significance,” see Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2356-57, to mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent.  Instead, this is only intended to point out that while it is clear that the Court intends these to be within the ambit of the Court’s bright-line prohibition so as to warrant application of the Mayo/Alice framework, it is not clear how to determine whether other concepts that don’t fall within either of these groups is intended to be within such ambit of the bright-line prohibition.
That is, with respect to an abstract ideas eligibility exception, the only things that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit”, Phillips, 324 U.S. at 493, of this bright-line prohibition are mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent.
 
The bright-line eligibility prohibition should be narrowly construed, and the Mayo/Alice test implementing it only applied for concepts plainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit.
As outlined in part one, given that the Alice/Mayo two-step framework is only designed to determine whether a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept barred by a bright-line prohibition, it would be reasonable to only apply the Alice/Mayo two-step test for concepts that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit,” Id., of the bright-line prohibition.
As noted above, with respect to an abstract ideas eligibility exception, mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent are arguably the only things that the Supreme Court has indicated to be “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit,” Id., of the bright-line prohibition.
Accordingly, given that the abstract ideas eligibility exception must be narrowly construed, it would be reasonable to only apply the bright-line prohibition to mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent, because “[t]o extend [such a bright-line prohibition] to other than those [concepts] plainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit is to abuse the interpretative process and to frustrate the announced will of the people.” Id.
Consequently, given that the Alice/Mayo two-step framework is only designed to determine whether a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept barred by this bright-line prohibition, it would be reasonable to only apply the Alice/Mayo two-step test for concepts that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit,” Id., of the bright-line prohibition, e.g. mathematical formulas and fundamental practices that are long prevalent.
Notably though, nothing in this article is intended to suggest that it is not possible to still apply the abstract ideas eligibility exception to other concepts which are not a mathematical formula or fundamental practice that is long prevalent.  For example, even if the Alice/Mayo test is not applied because a claim isn’t directed to a concept that the Supreme Court has “plainly and unmistakably [indicated to be] within [the] terms and spirit”, Id., of the bright-line prohibition, a claim could still be found ineligible under § 101.
Part three of this article elaborates on this, and suggests that even if the bright-line eligibility prohibition is construed narrowly, this would not foreclose the ability of the judiciary and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to address issues raised by claiming at a level of abstraction that results in overbroad claiming, either under 35 U.S.C. § 101 or under 35 U.S.C. § 112.

Role of the Specification and Prosecution History in Patent Eligibility Analysis | Patently-O,https://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/11/specification-prosecution-eligibility.html,"
by Dennis Crouch
The Federal Circuit’s decision in Two-Way Media is in some amount of tension with the court’s 2016 decision in Amdocs v. Openet Telecom.   In Amdocs, the court noted that the claims appeared problematic under Section 101 (abstract ideas), but that the architecture – as specifically described in the specification but more generically claimed – showed that the invention was actually a technological improvement.  In Two-Way Media, the court faced the same dilemma but arrived at the opposite conclusion — holding that although the specification described a technological improvement, the claims were written at too abstract a level to be patent eligible.
Note here that Judge Reyna dissented in Amdocs.  However, rather than accepting the Amdocs precedent, Reyna is now the author of Two-Way Media – a decision that does not cite Amdocs.  Wow.
Other cases in this intra-circuit-split include Smart Sys. Innovations, LLC v. Chicago Transit Auth.,(Fed. Cir. Oct. 18, 2017); Synopsys Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp., 839 F.3d 1138 (Fed. Cir. 2016); and Visual Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp., 867 F.3d 1253 (Fed. Cir. 2017).   The chart below shows these results with the invalidity opinion in blue, and validity opinion in orange.

Now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court is Openet’s petition for writ of certiorari asking the following question:

To be patent eligible, a patent must claim “the means or method of producing a certain result, or effect, and not [the] result or effect produced.” Corning v. Burden, 56 U.S. 252, 267-68 (1854). This principle has driven this Court’s patentable subject matter jurisprudence for over 150 years, including most recently the “search for an inventive concept” described in the second step of the Alice/Mayo framework. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2355 (2014) (quoting Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 72 (2012)). Because a patent’s claims define the scope of the invention, this Court stated in both Alice and Mayo that this second step of the eligibility analysis turns on what is “in the claims.” The question presented is:
Whether the Federal Circuit erred by looking beyond the claims to the patent specification to assess patent eligibility

In the pending case, petition-stage briefs are in and the court is scheduled for conference later this month.
 
I should note here that the patentee Amdocs disagrees with Openet’s characterization of what happened.  Rather, the patentee argues that “The Federal Circuit’s decision on patent eligibility thus rested not on material drawn willy-nilly from the specifications, but on the scope of the claims as construed in Amdocs I at Openet’s urging.”

Portal Communications Alleges Apple's Siri Willfully Infringes on Natural Language Processing Patents - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law,http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/03/17/portal-communications-alleges-apples-siri-willfully-infringes-natural-language-processing-patents/id=94673/,"

On March 8th, Plano, TX-based Portal Communications filed a suit for patent infringement against Cupertino, CA-based consumer tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) At issue in the case, which was filed in the Eastern District of Texas, are a series of patents covering natural language voice query technologies which are allegedly in use by Apple’s Siri digital personal assistant.
Portal Communications is asserting a series of three patents in its suit against Apple:

U.S. Patent No. 7376645, titled Multimodal Natural Language Query System and Architecture for Processing Voice and Proximity-Based Queries. Issued in May 2008, it claims a natural language query system including a speech input module, a location/proximity module, a speech conversion module converting speech inputs to text, a natural language processing module to convert the text into searchable text using lexicons and grammar rules to parse sentences and determine underlying meanings, a semantic engine module converting the searchable text into a formal database query, and a database-lookup-module that obtains a result related to the query.
U.S. Patent No. 7873654, titled Multimodal Natural Language Query System for Processing and Analyzing Voice and Proximity-Based Queries. Issued in January 2011, it claims a system similar to the ‘645 patent that requires only a single iteration to pinpoint a result to a voice-based query, improving upon previous software products which required multiple iterations to find results.
U.S. Patent No. 8150872, same title as the ‘654 patent. Issued in April 2012, tt discloses a query system including a computing device connected to a network and a server communicatively coupled to the device via the network, the server configured to receive a query from an audio input at the device and perform natural language processing on the query without the need for voice training.

According to Portal’s complaint, the patents-in-suit were originally developed by Dave Bernard, a pioneer in natural language processing and other technologies relevant to the patents. Prior to Bernard’s inventions, human interactions with computing devices and Web-based queries were primarily through non-voice input means, such as keyboards or mice. Software products at the time that did enable users to make voice-based queries often did so for limited functions, such as opening or closing files, and utilized voice training techniques which often produced unreliable results in response to voice queries. Such voice training systems take a long time to produce better results and tend to provide less accurate results to those other than the human user involved in the voice training.
In arguing for enhanced damages for willful infringement of the patents-in-suit, Portal Communications alleges that Apple has had knowledge of both the ‘645 and the ‘654 patents since at least June 2012, when either patent was cited by Apple in patent applications which it filed that month with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Portal alleges that Apple has over 75 patent publications which cite to the ‘645 patent and more than 100 patent publications which cite to the ‘654 patent. Portal’s allegations focus on a very wide range of Apple products including multiple generations of the iPhone, iPad, iMac and MacBook models dating back to late 2009, especially those devices which are used in combination with Siri natural voice query processing technology. “Further, to the extent Defendant continues its infringing activities post-suit, such infringement would be clearly and necessarily willful,” Portal argues.
Interestingly, Portal goes to great lengths in the complaint in a seeming attempt to head off any attempt to invalidate the patents under 35 U.S.C. § 101, a very real concern for patent owners asserting patents in district court during the current patentability climate. In presenting the technologies covered by each patent asserted in the case, Portal cites specific ways in which each patented technology improved prior art technologies, such as attributing meanings to words based on their spoken context and permitting users to interact with natural language query systems in multiple ways. Portal argues that each patent provides an inventive concept; does not claim an abstract idea; does not claim well-known, fundamental economic or conventional business practices; does not preempt an abstract idea; cannot be practiced by a human alone; constitutes the application of inventive ideas not existing or obvious; and necessitates the use of discrete hardware and software components programmed in a particular way to enable performance of the specified functions.
Anyone who has followed recent case law regarding patentability standards under Section 101 will likely recognize Portal’s attempt to prevent Apple’s ability to invalidate the asserted patents under the standard set by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International, a case which significantly narrowed the patentability of software and business methods by invalidating a patent covering a method for exchanging financial obligations using a computer system as a third-party intermediary. SCOTUS found that the application of a well-known economic practice through a computer system did not meet the basic Section 101 threshold for patentability, rendering the claimed invention unpatentable as an abstract idea. It’s not inconceivable that Apple could argue for Section 101 invalidity under the Alice standard as natural language processing is something that human beings have done for millennia.
Such preemption of a patentability argument is especially warranted given the defendant being targeted by Portal. Apple has previously shown itself very willing to go to far lengths in order to invalidate patents which they have been declared guilty of infringing. For example, Apple has previously gone to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to invalidate Smartflash’s patents covering data storage and accessed systems practiced by the iTunes Store, wiping out a $533 million damages award for willful patent infringement handed out by a federal district court. Apple also successfully petitioned the PTAB to invalidate patents covering secure communications technologies owned by VirnetX, wiping out more than $1 billion in valuable private property. Apple was successful in invalidating the VirnetX patents despite the fact that it petitioned for validity review more than one year after VirnetX first asserted those patents against Apple, which should have put Apple outside of the statute of limitations in petitioning for validity reviews by the PTAB. Clearly, Portal has picked a perilous foe in this case, the entity’s first suit filed in district court to allege patent infringement.
