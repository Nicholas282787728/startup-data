    "1. I went through the folders – most look good, but it’s possible there’s some missing material. Spend a little more time to perfect the downloading  code. See if you can fix whichever errors you find through the process. It might be best to make this code as smooth as possible now, before we scale to working with lots of companies.\n",
    "2. I am assuming the scraping process is OK, but it’s probably helpful to take one more look at that too (i.e. for example, those few lines missing in the TXT we looked at together may happen elsewhere too, no huge deal but worth looking into it).\n",
    "3. Once you’ve finalized the downloading process, let’s start with a very simple exercise on the TXT files. For each TXT of each company, write a code that counts the number of times the following keywords are mentioned: PROTOTYPE, TEST, EXPERIMENT, MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT, BETA, ALPHA. This is just a start, we’ll do more of this, but let’s see how this goes. You can then input this data into an Excel file (one row per company).\n",

    "If possible, please write your Python code clearly and upload it. So I can try to take a look.\n",
